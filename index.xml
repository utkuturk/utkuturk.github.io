<section id="what" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what">What?</h3>
<p>During my PhD, I’ve become fairly obsessed with production studies. I find them extremely interesting, especially the way they combine what we know from theoretical linguistics with creative experimental methods. Not to mention that the theoretical framing of production work is quite poor and the main theories used need a major overhaul. One of the most interesting papers in this area is Shota Momma’s work on advanced verb planning. Similar work was also done in German and Basque by Sebastian Sauppe’s group.</p>
<p>Let me set the scene. He and his colleagues ran multiple picture description experiments where participants saw images like:</p>
<ul>
<li>“The octopus below the spoon is swimming” (unergative)</li>
<li>“The octopus below the spoon is boiling” (unaccusative)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re not a syntax nerd, here’s the ultra-compressed version: verbs like “swim” and “bark” (unergatives) are different from verbs like “sink” and “melt” (unaccusatives), even though they both describe single-argument events. The difference has to do with argument structure—where the subject comes from in the underlying syntax. It has been argued that the subjects of unaccusatives are actually ‘deep objects’ for lack of a better term, and they structurally start in the same position as any other object.</p>
<p>They showed that these two verb types behave differently in production experiments. Speakers plan them differently. They tested this by showing related or unrelated words superimposed on the pictures. They found that when the verbs were related, participants slowed down before they started speaking—but only with unaccusatives. His theoretical claim was that unaccusative verbs are planned <em>earlier</em> in the sentence production process—possibly right at the beginning, along with the subject.</p>
</section>
<section id="why-though" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-though">Why though?</h3>
<p>Here’s the thing. Another thing that made me very excited about the production endeavor is that there are probably so many possible confounds that require checking. And I love this song and dance in psycholinguistics, where I can stress-test findings and see how stable they are. It’s especially important when you find an unexpected result—like participants taking <strong>longer to start speaking</strong> when they won’t say the verb for at least 3 more seconds—my first instinct, and I hope yours, is to wonder: “Is this real, or is something else going on?”</p>
<p>This post is built on a very specific worry: <strong>What if unaccusative scenes themselves, and not the syntax of them, created the results?</strong> One interesting finding in Shota Momma’s papers was that unergative planning was seemingly invisible. He has shown that there are reasons to believe that it happens while saying the second NP. But quantitatively, the signature of unergative planning seems to be more dissolved throughout the sentence, while the unaccusative planning is strikingly clear.</p>
<p>This creates the following question: is it possible that participants, simply because the picture was more difficult to understand or the subject was more involved in the action, spent more time initially to either understand the event or to extract the subject from the event, and during this time a deterministic analysis of the written word kicked in and slowed them down when it was related? Since the unergative subjects are more easily dissociable from the event, since nothing is happening to them in those pictures, it takes less time, and since it’s less of a resource-heavy process, no additional process interferes with it. This has several predictions. First, in follow-up experiments where the unergative pictures are hard to ‘retrieve’ from the scene, one should see similar onset effects. Second, if there is some sort of picture-difficulty metric, the advance planning should align with that metric item-wise.</p>
<p>The second prediction is going to be the basis of this blog post, where we will find a way to quantify the picture difficulty.<sup>1</sup></p>

<section id="i-make-assumptions" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="i-make-assumptions">I make assumptions</h3>
<p>I assume the following ‘two-way’ distinction with respect to lexical verbs. However, one needs to admit that unaccusativity is not stable all the time. Many such unaccusative verbs can be used as unergatives given some adverbial modification or different contexts. This would create some minor infelicity in English, but that is not the case for many languages. For example, Laz can make any verb ‘agentive’ with a small prefix. Imagine a Laz-type English where you have “I cried” vs.&nbsp;“I do-cried,” where the second one means that you made yourself cry or you deliberately cried. Or a better example might be: imagine if English “jump” were decomposable into a prefix “do-” and “fall.” So, for now I only assume that these properties are lexical properties of the verb, but one needs to admit that these are event-related ones.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unergative actions</strong> (swimming, barking, running): The action is performed by the agent. You can see the octopus swimming—the action is somewhat separable from what happens to the entity.</li>
<li><strong>Unaccusative actions</strong> (boiling, melting, sinking): Something is <em>happening to</em> the entity. The octopus isn’t “doing” boiling—it’s <em>undergoing</em> a change of state. The action and the entity are less separable.</li>
</ul>
<p>Another assumption I make is about CLIP/VLM. The input that CLIP takes is a written sentence and a picture. I am fully aware that the way CLIP assesses pictures is nowhere near how humans do.<sup>2</sup> I am also aware that in human speech, the scenes are what is encoded and the speech is the decoding. CLIP works differently. CLIP is a two-encoder model. Given two inputs of a picture and a text, it creates two separate vectors and checks how similar those vectors are. Thus, it does not give us anything about human cognition. But it gives us a way to quantify relevant metrics. Below what I assume to be the models of human speech production based on Levelt’s work and CLIP’s architecture.</p>

<p><strong>Multimodal LLMs:</strong></p>
<p>More recently, multimodal large language models have emerged that work quite differently from CLIP. Instead of creating separate embeddings and comparing them, these models integrate visual and textual information into a unified representation and can generate natural language descriptions or answers about images.</p>
<p>I have to say, writing their code is also a bit funny. You basically have to build a pipeline where you create a ‘chat template’ and ask them to give you an output. I am not sure that is how you are supposed to use them, but it works.<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>Models like <a href="https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen3-Omni">Qwen3-Omni</a> take both images and text as input, process them through vision encoders and language models together, and generate coherent text outputs. Unlike CLIP’s similarity metric, multimodal LLMs can provide richer, more nuanced interpretations of visual scenes and answer complex questions about them. We will use both of them and compare here.</p>

<p>Lastly, these experiments were conducted as a extended-PWI experiment, where participants were provided with a picture with a superimposed text on it. Neither the pictures, nor the tasks I improvise here does not have any relation to picture word interference task. It would be indeed interesting if we have an understanding how PWI would look like interms of LLM tasks. However it is far from what I would like to achieve here. If I have that idea I will probably submit a paper or an abstract somewhere :).</p>

<section id="predictions" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="predictions">Predictions</h3>
<p>If unaccusative actions (like “boiling” or “melting”) are genuinely harder to see in pictures, or if the subjects are harder to visually identify in the scenes, we’d expect: - <strong>Lower similarity scores</strong> between the images and their target sentences - Evidence that models struggle to “ground” the sentence/entity in the visual input, in the form of subject saliency.</p>
<p>If that’s the case, we have a problem—the onset latency effect might just be about picture difficulty.<sup>4</sup></p>
<p>But if the similarity scores are <strong>comparable or higher</strong> for unaccusatives, then we can rule out the perceptual confound for now and be more confident that the effects reflect genuine linguistic processing.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-deeper-dive-with-bayesian-analysis">A Deeper Dive with Bayesian Analysis</h3>
<p>While the plots above give us a good first look, they don’t tell the whole story. To really understand the strength of the evidence, we need to go beyond just comparing averages. This is where Bayesian analysis comes in.</p>
<p>Instead of just getting a single number for the difference, a Bayesian regression gives us a full range of plausible values for the effect of <code>VerbType</code> on our scores, along with a measure of our certainty.</p>
<p>For the nerds out there, I used Pyro to run three separate models: two simple linear regressions for the CLIP and Subject Salience scores, and an ordered logistic regression for the VLM scores (since they are on a 1-10 scale). In all models, the key parameter is <code>beta</code>, which represents the estimated difference between unaccusative and unergative verbs.</p>
<p>Here’s the code to set up and run the models:</p>

<p>The plot below visualizes the results of our Bayesian models. For each of our three metrics, it shows the estimated effect of the verb type. Because we coded unaccusatives as +0.5 and unergatives as -0.5, the “Beta” (β) value represents the difference between the two.</p>
<p>The vertical gray line at zero is our baseline for “no effect”. If the colored whisker line (the posterior distribution) for a metric crosses this line, it means we can’t be very confident in the direction of the effect. However, this ‘confidence’ of course will be quantified by the probability values shown on the right side of the plot.</p>
<p>If the distribution is shifted to the left of zero (Negative β), it means that unaccusative scenes scored lower than unergative ones for that metric. This is the “danger zone” for our stimuli, as it would suggest they are harder for the models to process. As you can see, both the full sentence similarity and the VLM verification scores are shifted heavily to the left, indicating that the unaccusative pictures are indeed less clear or representative.</p>
<p>If the distribution were on the right side (Positive β), it would mean unaccusatives scored <em>higher</em>, suggesting they were actually easier for the models. None of our metrics show this result.</p>

<p>So, what do these models tell us? The results are quite clear: all three of our metrics point in the same direction, suggesting that the unaccusative scenes are in some way more challenging than the unergative ones.</p>
<p>Here’s a quick summary of the findings from our Bayesian analysis:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scene Verification (VLM):</strong> A strong negative effect (β ≈ -2.3, P(β&lt;0) = 0.99). The VLM is very confident that the unaccusative sentences are a worse description of their corresponding images.</li>
<li><strong>Full Scene (CLIP):</strong> A similarly strong negative effect (β ≈ -2.3, P(β&lt;0) = 0.92). CLIP also finds a lower visual-textual fit for unaccusative scenes.</li>
<li><strong>Subject Salience (CLIP):</strong> A moderate negative effect (β ≈ -1.5, P(β&lt;0) = 0.83). The evidence is weaker here, with more uncertainty, but it still suggests that the subject is slightly harder to identify in unaccusative scenes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even before we get to the human data, the models are sending a clear signal: these two sets of pictures might not be perceived equally. The unaccusative scenes seem to have a lower “visual-textual fit”, which means we have to be careful not to mistake this perceptual difficulty for a purely linguistic effect.</p>
<p>One interpretation is that the production effects we see in humans might be at least <em>partially</em> due to the visual complexity of the pictures. However, given the broader context of the sentence production literature, this seems unlikely to be the whole story. Other studies have found similar advance planning effects in experiments that did not involve these pictures or pictures at all, such as sentence recall tasks. This suggests that the effect is not just about visual processing, but is tied to the linguistic structure of the sentences themselves.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-finding">The Finding</h3>
<p>The analysis reveals a consistent pattern across all three metrics: unaccusative scenes are rated as more difficult or less representative by the models compared to unergative scenes.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Scene Verification (VLM):</strong> The Qwen-VL model, which was asked to explicitly rate the match between the sentence and the image, showed a strong negative effect for unaccusatives. It consistently gave lower scores to unaccusative pairs, with a high degree of certainty (P(β&lt;0) = 0.99). This suggests that from a generative, “common sense” perspective, the unaccusative sentences are poorer descriptions of their corresponding images.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Full Scene Similarity (CLIP):</strong> The standard CLIP similarity score also revealed a strong negative effect for unaccusatives (P(β&lt;0) = 0.92). This indicates that the overall visual-textual fit is lower for unaccusative scenes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Subject Salience (CLIP):</strong> Even the salience of the subject noun was moderately lower in unaccusative scenes (P(β&lt;0) = 0.83). While the evidence is weaker here, it suggests that the subject may be slightly harder to identify in the context of an unaccusative event.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In short, the models are telling us that the unaccusative pictures are not as clear-cut as the unergative ones.</p>

<section id="what-this-means" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-this-means">What This Means</h3>
<p>This computational analysis provides a crucial piece of context for the human experimental results. The key takeaway is that the unaccusative stimuli seem to be inherently more complex or ambiguous than the unergative stimuli.</p>
<p>This doesn’t invalidate the syntactic hypothesis about advance planning, but it does add a layer of nuance. The increased processing cost observed in human speakers for unaccusative sentences might not be solely due to a syntactic operation. Instead, it could be a combination of factors:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Perceptual/Conceptual Difficulty:</strong> The visual scenes for unaccusative events might be harder to parse, conceptualize, and map onto a linguistic description. The AI models, particularly the VLM, seem to be picking up on this.</li>
<li><strong>Syntactic Planning:</strong> The syntactic structure of unaccusatives may still require earlier planning, as originally hypothesized.</li>
</ul>
<p>The most likely scenario is that these two factors are intertwined. The very nature of unaccusative events (a change of state happening <em>to</em> a patient) makes them visually more complex, and this complexity might be what triggers the earlier, more resource-intensive syntactic planning.</p>
<p>We can be more confident that the experimental effects are not just due to simple visual confounds like a hidden subject, but we must also acknowledge that the “difficulty” is not purely syntactic. It’s a property of the entire event, from perception to syntax.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>If you’re running experiments with visual stimuli, I highly recommend giving this a try. Vision-language models like CLIP and multimodal LLMs like Qwen are freely available and give us principled ways to ask: “Are these pictures doing what we think they’re doing?” The ability to triangulate across different model architectures—from similarity-based (CLIP) to generative (Qwen)—provides an unprecedented level of confidence in our experimental materials.</p>
<p>This analysis didn’t end up changing my theoretical interpretation of the experimental findings, I think existing evidence for advance planning require more than random LLM analysis, which probably has nothing to do how humans represent concepts, sentences, or visual areas.</p>
<p>One thing that I need to do a baseline analysis in which I ran the similar analysis for a randomly assigned sentence-picture pairs to show that, when randomized the clip similarity changes dramatically. I will soon run that and upload the results as a comment.</p>
<p>If you want to run this analysis yourself, you can use the following Colab notebook: <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/utkuturk/utkuturk.github.io/blob/main/clip_analysis.ipynb"><img aria-label="Open In Colab" src="https://www.utkuturk.com/posts/clip/data:image/svg+xml;base64,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" class="img-fluid" alt="Open In Colab"></a> You can download the cached_scores here: <a href="https://github.com/utkuturk/utkuturk.github.io/blob/main/posts/clip/cached_scores.csv">cached_scores.csv</a>, and the pictures here: <a href="https://github.com/utkuturk/utkuturk.github.io/blob/main/posts/clip/pictures.zip">pictures.zip</a></p>

<p><strong>A Note on AI Generated Images</strong>: While this post details a technical solution for generating stimuli using AI, I firmly believe that human artistry is irreplaceable. I am not sure how ethical it is to use these pictures. I would much rather have a human artist draw these materials. If you are an artist interested in collaborating on linguistic experiments, <strong>please email me</strong>. I would be more than happy to drop this AI pipeline and work with you instead.</p>

<section id="introduction" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>If you’ve ever tried to create experimental stimuli for a linguistic study, you know the struggle. You need depictions of transitive actions that are valid, recognizable, but also controlled. You want your “Wizard” to look like the same Wizard whether he’s eating an apple or throwing a frisbee.</p>
<p>Finding consistent pictures for picture word interference tasks—or even simple production tasks that involve lexical verbs—is notoriously difficult. Most existing resources and production experiments focus heavily on nominals (nouns). Finding relevant images on the web is also very difficult. And whenever, you want to use stock images, you worry about a lot of different stuff going on in each image. Many acquisition labs actually record their students do the actions for other type of experiments.</p>
<p>I recently needed 60 distinct, stylistically consistent line drawings for a morphology experiment. I didn’t want to spend weeks drawing or learning how to draw them, and I didn’t want to wrestle with inconsistencies from standard web-based image generators or image searching. Existing databases did not provide a good quality verb sentences.</p>
<p>So, I built a code-first pipeline using Google’s Gemini 2.5 Flash Image and open-source alternatives like FLUX.1 via Hugging Face.</p>
<p>Here is how I did it.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-problem-consistency-vs.-chaos" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-problem-consistency-vs.-chaos">The Problem: Consistency vs.&nbsp;Chaos</h2>
<p>The main issue with generative AI for experiments is consistency. If I ask for “A wizard eating an apple” and then “A wizard kicking a ball,” I usually get two completely different wizards. Different robes, different beards, different vibes. Especially, if you do this over gemini website, with bunch of prompt, it is bound to mess it up.</p>
<p>For my experiment, I needed: 1. <strong>3 Characters</strong>: Wizard, Pirate, Chef. 2. <strong>20 Actions</strong>: 10 regular verbs, 10 irregular verbs. 3. <strong>Strict Style</strong>: Clean black and white line drawings (coloring book style).</p>
</section>
<section id="the-toolkit" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-toolkit">The Toolkit</h2>
<p>I chose a programmatic approach because clicking “Generate” 60 times is not my idea of a good time. Plus, I needed reproducibility.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gemini 2.5 Flash Image</strong>: It’s incredibly fast and follows instructions well. Plus, Gemini Pro is often free for students, and Google AI Studio offers a $300 credit to work with for over 30 days, making it very accessible.</li>
<li><strong>Hugging Face Inference API</strong>: Allows me to swap in models like <code>black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev</code> if I need a different aesthetic. I am also considering other models like QWEN or anything that is up right now.</li>
<li><strong>Python</strong>: The glue holding it all together.</li>
</ul>
<section id="getting-your-credentials" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="getting-your-credentials">Getting Your Credentials</h3>
<p>Since we are using Gemini, you’ll need an API key. It’s surprisingly easy to get one:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Go to <strong><a href="https://aistudio.google.com/">Google AI Studio</a></strong>. As of now, it is not available everywhere.</li>
<li>Sign in with your Google account.</li>
<li>Click on the <strong>“Get API key”</strong> button on the top left.</li>
<li>Click <strong>“Create API key”</strong>. You can create it in a new project or an existing Google Cloud project.</li>
<li>Copy the key string (it starts with <code>AIza...</code>).</li>
<li>I suspect that you need to activate billing information, too. This includes putting down your credit card information. You can create an alarm for billing. Right now I have alarm for every 50 dollars. Since the first 300 is free, I doubt I will pass that.</li>
<li>(Optional) If you want to use FLUX, you’ll also need a <strong><a href="https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens">Hugging Face Token</a></strong> with “Write” permissions.</li>
</ol>

<section id="the-code" class="level2">

<p>I wrote a script, <code>generate_materials.py</code>, to handle the heavy lifting.</p>

<p>The results were surprisingly good. By combining the strict style prompt with the consistent character descriptions, I managed to get a set of stimuli that look like they belong in the same universe.</p>
<p>Of course, it wasn’t perfect. Sometimes the Pirate would have two eye patches, or the Chef would be holding the knife by the blade. But generating 60 images takes about 2 minutes with Gemini Flash, so I could just re-run the specific failures until they looked right.</p>

<p>Of course, “looking right” to me isn’t the same as scientific validity. The next step in this project is to run a norming study to check the validity of these generated images. I need to ensure that when a participant sees the “cutting bread” image, they actually retrieve the concept of <em>cutting</em> rather easily. And I also have to make sure that some of the items are too confusing or have a lot of more natural competitors.</p>

<p>This post grew out of a conversation I had with a professor about his workshop class on Turkic languages. He didn’t say this directly, but I’ve heard a familiar story from multiple students: when Turkish comes up, some chunk of class time gets involuntarily eaten by judgment battles.</p>
<p>Honestly, I’m not shocked. Since my MA I’ve heard plenty of “your Turkish is broken”. Mostly joking, sure. But there’s also a pattern: any talk with mildly non-obvious Turkish data gets peppered with unsolicited <em>“That’s not grammatical to me”</em> interventions. And yes, I’ve done it too. I’m not writing this from a high horse. This is also a personal critique.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>What I want to argue is simple: a lot of this practice is both methodologically unhelpful and kind of backwards relative to what many of us claim to be doing in linguistics.</p>
<p>And there’s a second point, which I care about more. Behind the futility of casual judgment policing, there’s a real lesson: people are often trying to say something important, but the only sentence they know how to produce in these contexts is “that’s ungrammatical”.</p>
<p><em>PS.</em> I’m writing this for linguists who are trying to understand what humans can do with language, what the limits are, and how the system is represented and deployed. If your main goal is to recover <em>the</em> “standard Turkish grammar” shared uniformly by all self-identified Turkish speakers, I genuinely wish you luck, but I don’t have much to offer beyond a lot of questions.</p>
<section id="what-does-thats-not-grammatical-to-me-even-mean" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-does-thats-not-grammatical-to-me-even-mean">What does “That’s not grammatical to me” even mean?</h2>
<p>Suppose you present a Turkish example and someone raises a hand (or asks a question after the talk) and says:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“I don’t think that sentence is grammatical.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That utterance is wildly underspecified. Here are a few things it can be (implicitly) trying to express.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Sometimes it (accidentally) sounds like:</strong> <em>“You made this up.”</em><br>
That’s a serious accusation. In my experience, almost nobody in our field intends that. But the <em>performative</em> effect can still be: “your data is suspect”.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sometimes they simply enjoy tautological facts:</strong> <em>“People differ, ‘standard language’ is a fiction, I-language matters.”</em><br>
True. Also not news. And as a conversational move, it sometimes functions like: “I don’t want you to talk to me (about this)”.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sometimes it’s straightforward prescriptivism:</strong> <em>“There is one Turkish, and let me tell you this isn’t it.”</em><br>
I’m still surprised how often this shows up <em>in linguistics</em>, including among people who otherwise talk a good game about variation and competence vs performance.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sometimes it’s an underlying strong claim about what ‘language’ is.</strong><br>
They might not think the individual brain can exercise the language faculty to different degrees, and they might (maybe unknowingly) treat “your language” as something defined almost entirely by your social circle.</p>
<p>I have two problems with this. First, speaker and listener often <em>aren’t</em> in the same community. Turkish is also especially sensitive to region, register, education, and class (don’t quote me on the comparative point here; I might just be more attuned to Turkish differences than to differences in other languages, but the general point still stands). Even with English speakers, judgments are not uniform, and plenty of cases are genuinely disputable. Second, even if social environment matters a lot, it’s a strange move to treat one person’s system as the yardstick that can revoke another person’s linguistic competence. We already accept that humans share a broad blueprint. We also often accept that speakers who understand each other effortlessly share even more. But once you zoom in (Turkish vs “Turkish”, dialect vs dialect, idiolect vs idiolect), we’re talking about degrees, and the differences you find are often local and structured, not “brokenness”.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sometimes it reflects not having thought much about what edge cases buy you:</strong> <em>“I actually haven’t thought about what there is to learn from edge cases.”</em><br>
In a world where there are many possible grammars (and many plausible formalizations), marginal cases are often where constraints show up. The “net return” on hunting boundaries can be high, precisely because broad generalizations saturate quickly. This is not to say we’ve done enough work on the “simple” examples, or that we should stop caring about them. But if your goal is to dissociate what is possible in the human language system, the marginal cases often have unusually good signal.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>And then there’s the version that is actually methodologically relevant.</p>
</section>
<section id="real-worry-i-representativeness" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="real-worry-i-representativeness">Real worry I: Representativeness</h2>
<p>Often what the objector <em>means</em> is something like:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“You’re portraying this as common in the language, but it’s only available for a subset of speakers.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If I’m being serious, I think this is what’s going on in a big fraction of “this is ungrammatical” interruptions. And yes, it can matter, because it affects what future readers take to be a baseline fact.</p>
<p>But notice what that worry requires you to do. You have to say more than “not for me”.</p>
<p>At minimum, you need to turn it into an empirical claim:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Which speakers?</em> (region, register, age cohort, bilingualism history, etc.)</li>
<li><em>How big is the split?</em> (rare? unstable? gradient? categorical for a subgroup?)</li>
<li><em>What exactly differs?</em> (syntax? morphology? prosody? information structure? lexical choice?)</li>
<li><em>Is the judgment robust under controlled elicitation?</em> (multiple prompts, contexts, minimal pairs)</li>
</ul>
<p>If this is not an empirical worry but a “philosophy of science” worry, in the sense that a paper might mislead outsiders into thinking Turkish works in a certain way, the fix is not heckling. The fix is metadata and methodology. I genuinely do not understand why so many syntax/semantics papers lack a short subsection about who the speakers were and what the elicitation conditions were.</p>
<p>Also, in practice, any work that seriously <em>builds</em> on Turkish facts should be doing basic replication of the descriptive premise anyway. If you’re going to hang theory on a datum you saw in a talk, you should first check that datum (with speakers, corpora, or both). That’s not a Turkish-specific point. And yes, I’ve unfortunately also seen famous linguists publish on languages they hadn’t worked on before, not even opening a grammar book, and then argue that facts reported in some earlier paper can be “explained away”. This is a different problem, but it’s in the same family.</p>

<p>There’s another charitable reading:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“This is a cool locus of variation.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I agree. I care a lot about cross-linguistic structure, and about how the “borders” of grammatical processes are patterned rather than random. Mapping where variation arises (and where it doesn’t) can be informative about representational choices and decision points in the system.</p>
<p>But again, “that’s ungrammatical to me” is a terrible way to pursue that agenda if it comes with no follow-up. It’s like walking into a lab meeting, saying “noise”, and leaving.</p>
<p>If you think variation is the point, then do variation: ask about variation. Propose a hypothesis about the dimensions along which it varies, and propose how you’d test it.</p>

<p>Another possible reading is:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“If you run the usual tests (X, Y, Z), I suspect you won’t get this reading. Do you still?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is not as charitable as the previous ones, because it often carries an authority move: it can sound like “are you sure you know what you’re doing?” Sometimes that’s needed, sure, especially if a claim hinges on a standard diagnostic. But it still matters how you ask it.</p>
<p>A better way to do this is to ask what diagnostics were run and whether the result survives them. Or whether there are “asterisks” that need to be made explicit. Sometimes that’s the real disconnect: you’re using “grammatical” in a looser, more exploratory way, while the audience is using it in the “passes the canonical tests in the canonical contexts” way.</p>

<section id="possibly-better-questions" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="possibly-better-questions">Possibly better questions</h2>
<p>If you feel the itch to say “not for me”, try one of these instead:</p>
<ul>
<li>“In <em>my</em> Turkish (I grew up in X / I mostly use Y register), I don’t get this. Do you know which variety you’re targeting?”</li>
<li>“What context makes this natural for your consultants? Could you give a minimal pair?”</li>
<li>“Is this intended as a claim about Turkish generally, or about a specific subset of speakers?”</li>
<li>“Did you elicit this with multiple speakers, or is it introspective? (Both are fine, but they support different conclusions.)”</li>
<li>“If we assume this varies, what would we predict should co-vary with it?”</li>
</ul>
<p>Otherwise it’s just time lost.</p>

  <title>saving pcibex recordings to s3 with a python lambda</title>

<p>For a bit time I have been trying create my own server in my home using my old computer. But until now, I decided to use Amazon S3 to store participant recordings. Unfortunately, the official <a href="https://doc.pcibex.net/how-to-guides/sending-recordings-to-an-s3-bucket.html">PCIbex guide</a> is out of date. This post shows how to send PCIbex audio recordings directly to Amazon S3 using a Python AWS Lambda. It’s a modern replacement for the older JS/S3 guide from the official PCIbex website.</p>
<p>A few practical notes up front:</p>
<ul>
<li>This version uses Python and lets you control how the uploaded recordings are named and stored.</li>
<li><strong>AWS credits:</strong> Amazon often gives up to <strong>$200</strong> in credits, which has been plenty for my dissertation-scale needs. Your university may also have a credits agreement, and you can independently apply for research credits using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/government-education/research-and-technical-computing/cloud-credit-for-research/">Amazon’s own portal</a>.</li>
<li>I’m not a fan of Amazon’s market power, but if you don’t have money for other services or a home server, AWS is a pragmatic choice.</li>
<li>This walkthrough assumes you’re <strong>not</strong> self-hosting PCIbex; you’re using the main <strong>https://farm.pcibex.net</strong> site.</li>
<li>Long term, I recommend learning the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cli/"><strong>AWS CLI</strong></a> and doing most of this from the command line—the console UI is clunky and ever-changing. It is just that I still don’t know how to do that.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the jargon feels like alphabet soup, ignore it for now. Roughly: <strong>S3</strong> is a secure Dropbox; <strong>Lambda</strong> is a piece of code that runs when triggered; <strong>API Gateway</strong> is the doorbell that triggers the Lambda.</p>
<section id="ethics-compliance" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="ethics-compliance">Ethics &amp; compliance</h3>
<p>Voice recordings are <strong>personally identifiable</strong>. Before collecting or storing them, talk to your institution’s security/compliance office (for me: UMD SPARCS). Describe what you collect, where it’s stored (S3), who can access it (IAM policies), and for how long.</p>

<li>Call <code>InitiateRecorder(&lt;your-url&gt;)</code> at the start of the experiment.<br>
</li>
<li>Call <code>UploadRecordings(...)</code> between trials or at the end.<br>
</li>
<li>Your Lambda receives the uploaded ZIP and writes it to S3, then returns <code>{ "ok": true }</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>No extra JavaScript in PCIbex, no PHP server.</p>

<li><strong>PCIbex</strong> runs in the participant’s browser and records audio.<br>

<li>It calls your <strong>API Gateway</strong> URL.<br>

<li><strong>API Gateway</strong> triggers <strong>a Python Lambda</strong>.<br>
</li>
<li>The Lambda accepts <strong>multipart/form-data</strong> from PCIbex and saves the file to <strong>S3</strong>.<br>

<li>The Lambda responds <code>{ "ok": true }</code> so PCIbex continues.</li>

<p>You can keep that pattern, or upload <strong>once at the end</strong> with a single <code>UploadRecordings()</code> in your sequence. The end-of-experiment approach allows participants to <strong>download their ZIP</strong> if the server is unreachable; the fully async pattern does not.</p>

  <title>misunderstanding Kate’s talk on nonuniformity of phonology and phonetics</title>
  <dc:creator>Utku Turk</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.utkuturk.com/posts/misunderstanding-kate/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>This post is part of a series I’m calling <em>Misunderstandings</em>. The idea is simple: I pick up on talks, papers, or arguments that I admire but also don’t quite buy in the way they’re framed. Sometimes I pose counterexamples, sometimes I just get tangled in the details. The label isn’t meant as dismissive—usually the “misunderstanding” is mine—but I find that pushing on these points is a good way to clarify what’s at stake.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Kate Mooney’s recent talk at UMass, <em>Segmental phonology, gestural phonetics: Explaining asymmetries between phonological and phonetic operations</em>, was about something deceptively simple: are phonological processes uniform?</p>
<p>The traditional view has been “yes.” If an alternation applies freely, that’s phonology. If it’s tied to a particular morpheme, that’s phonology too, just gated by a diacritic, indexed constraint, or cyclic ranking. The assumption is that the underlying machinery is the same; what differs is timing and scope.</p>
<p>Kate pushed back. She focused on vowel harmony versus vowel co-articulation. Zsiga had already argued these belong to different representational domains—rules vs gestures—but Kate sharpened the contrast. Vowel harmony: categorical, typologically robust, governed by rules. Vowel coarticulation: gradient, gestural blending, and crucially never morphologically restricted. That asymmetry, she argued, is real. If you try to collapse the two into one “uniform phonology,” you erase those typological gaps.</p>

<p>It’s a nice move because it comes with clear predictions. You shouldn’t get consonant copy or epenthesis as general phonotactic repairs, only as morphologically restricted alternations. You shouldn’t get morphologically restricted coarticulation. The grid is crisp: categorical + restricted = phonology, gradient + free = phonetics.</p>
<p>I should also say I’m not hostile to this move. In fact, I like the idea that phonology and phonetics are not a uniform system. Substance-free phonology has long made a similar claim: phonology is its own representational domain, not reducible to phonetic substance. I’ve always found that perspective appealing, and Kate’s framework fits that general spirit even though she keeps an arm’s-length stance toward committing to any particular theory.</p>
<p>But I’m suspicious of two-level partitions in general. I feel like in cognitive sciences, whenever there is a hard to explain data, first instinct of many people is to propose a two-level model. Automatic vs controlled processing, System 1 vs System 2 reasoning, parsing vs grammar. Sometimes, this two-level model is needed, especially when it is used to isolate a problem. For example, in the case of I-language idea, it was a powerful tool to carve a theoretical space just to discuss grammar. However, as theorization accumulated, this distinction sometimes used as a pile of “I-actually-dont-have-any-idea-so-it-might-be-processing”.</p>
<p>This pattern is everywhere in cognitive science, and all of these frameworks—including what Kate’s suggesting—share the same basic architecture: one process is fast, automatic, and associative; the other is slow, deliberate, and rule-based. The hope is that human behavior can be explained by sorting phenomena into the right bin. And of course, if you set out to show that sometimes people behave automatically and make mistakes; sometimes they behave deliberately and do not make mistakes, you’ll find confirmation all over the place.</p>
<p>But as Gawronski, Sherman &amp; Trope (2014) point out, dual-process theories only make progress if they meet a demanding set of conditions: they must specify what the two systems actually are (their operating principles), not just when they operate; they must define the boundaries of each system clearly; and they must generate empirical predictions that could, in principle, be falsified. Otherwise, they collapse into post-hoc labeling—System 1 when it’s effortless, System 2 when it’s not. While dual-process frameworks can be falsifiable in principle, they are often <em>practically unfalsifiable</em> because the internal ‘systems’ aren’t anchored to observable input–output relations. Almost any finding can be retrofitted: if an effect looks automatic, it’s assigned to System 1; if it’s resource-dependent, to System 2.</p>
<p>That’s my main worry here. Dual-process models are a tempting last resort. They look tidy, but they often function as theories that can’t really lose—precisely the kind that Popper warned us about. John von Neumann put it bluntly: <em>“With four parameters I can fit an elephant, and with five I can make him wiggle his trunk.”</em> And if you add one more, you can even make him wink. There’s even an R implementation—the <a href="https://www.r-bloggers.com/2011/06/a-winking-pink-elephant/">winking pink elephant</a>—that literally draws and animates an elephant with just a handful of parameters. It’s cute, but it’s also the point: if your model is that flexible, fitting isn’t the same thing as explaining. (The original code is base R/MASS heavy, but you can rewrite it cleanly with <code>ggplot2</code> and <code>dplyr</code>.)</p>

<p>That’s where Turkish comes in.</p>
<section id="the-turkish-case" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-turkish-case">The Turkish case</h2>
<p>As it is almost a common knowledge, Turkish exhibit multiple vowel harmonies. Harmonization spread from left to right. The easier one is the backness/frontness harmony. For example, the plural morpheme in Turkish can surface as either -lar or -ler, depending on the last vowel in the word that they are attaching. It is argued that plural morpheme is underspecified in its backness characteristics. And, whatever the value of the previous vowel, it spread into the plural morpheme.</p>
<ul>
<li>[yzym] + /-lAr/ -&gt; [yzymler]</li>
<li>[adam] + /-lAr/ -&gt; [adamlar]</li>
</ul>
<p>Another present harmony is Backness and Roundness Harmony. For example, the accusative case can surface as -ɨ, -i, -u, -y in Turkish. Again, the way that it is going to surface is completely dependent on the previous vowel. In this case, the accusative case is underspecified for its roundness and backness, but not underspecified for its height, -I.</p>
<ul>
<li>[adam] + /-I/ -&gt; [adamɨ]</li>
<li>[herif] + /-I/ -&gt; [herifi]</li>
<li>[odun] + /-I/ -&gt; [odunu]</li>
<li>[yzym] + /-I/ -&gt; [yzymy]</li>
</ul>
<p>Turkish does not have any other widely accepted vowel harmony apart from these two. This means that Turkish normally doesn’t have free-standing rounding harmony. Moreover, Turkish vowel harmony is strictly word-internal and left-to-right. Backwards harmony is virtually absent. Between-word harmony is nonexistent.</p>
<p>However, there is an interesting case in which all of these properties are overhauled. Turkish exhibit optional vowel characteristic change in a very specific environment. In fast production of complex noun phrases (an NP and a modifier), speakers often round the initial vowel of the second NP (NP2) if:</p>
<ul>
<li>The last vowel of NP1 is [+round].<br>
</li>
<li>The first vowel of NP2 is [+high, –round].<br>
</li>
<li>The second vowel of NP2 is [+round].<br>
</li>
<li>NP1 ends in a single consonant (clusters tend to block it).</li>
</ul>
<!-- Insert Praat spectrogram/formant track: sequence V[round] – V[high, –round] – V[round], showing F2 lowering in the middle vowel with/without assimilation. -->
<p>Examples (NP1 modifiers in italics):</p>
<ul>
<li><em>bir</em> ikon (one icon) → [bir ikon] but <em>on</em> ikon (ten icons) → [on ykon]</li>
<li><em>iki</em> milyon (two millions) → [iki miljon] but <em>dokuz</em> milyon (nine millions) → [dokuz mylyon]<br>
</li>
<li><em>güzel</em> vizyon (beautiful vision) → [gyzel vizyon] but <em>hoş</em> vizyon (nice vision) → [hoʃ vyzyon]</li>
<li><em>bazı</em> sigorta (some insurance) → [bazɨ sigorta] but <em>tüm</em> sigorta (whole insurance) → [tym sygorta]</li>
<li><em>tek</em> biyoloji (single biology) → [tek bijoloʒi] but <em>vücut</em> biyoloji (body biology) → [vyʒut byjoloʒi]</li>
</ul>
<p>Not everything goes through:</p>
<ul>
<li>üç <em>nilüfer</em> (three lilies) → [ytʃ nilüfer] (no rounding)<br>
</li>
<li>tüm <em>limon</em> (whole lemon) → [tym limon] (no rounding)<br>
</li>
<li>küçük <em>işgücü</em> (small workforce) → [küçük işgücü] (blocked by CC cluster)</li>
</ul>
<!-- Insert table: columns for NP1 type, NP1 final vowel, NP2 initial vowel, NP2 second vowel, outcome (rounding / no rounding). Positive vs negative examples grouped. -->
<p>Loanwords are especially revealing. Epenthetic vowels often participate: <em>hipodrom</em>, <em>sigorta</em>, <em>diskotek</em>. Compounds resist, especially when the boundary is vowel–vowel. Some high-frequency words seem entrenched with disharmony, like <em>dinazor</em> (originally <em>dinozor</em>). There are also asymmetries with labials: sometimes a labial consonant plus a preceding rounded vowel creates the right environment, but not always (<em>nilüfer</em> resists).</p>
<!-- Insert scatterplot or bar chart: proportion of rounding observed by word type—loanwords, compounds, simple NPs, etc. -->
</section>
<section id="why-it-bugs-me" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-it-bugs-me">Why it bugs me</h2>
<p>At first glance, this seems like a good evidence for Kate’s argument.</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s optional: It does not necessarily go through, actually you will hear people do not make the rounding bunch of the times.</li>
<li>It’s gradient: I do not feel like the vowel quality of the rounded one is similar to other round vowels.</li>
<li>It seems to apply semi-automatically in fast speech.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, Kate’s argument relies on the non-collapsibility of the quadrant. An event that looks like this should be co-articulation, and should happen irregardless of morphological or syntactic environment. However, that is not the case for this phenomenon. This specific bidirectional vowel harmony, or stuck vowel, only occurs within the syntactically complex DPs. It does not occur within the same word when the same configuration exist. On the contrary, within the same root, there is an additional push for creating disharmony [see <a href="https://brucehayes.org/251VowelHarmony/Readings/ClementsSezer1982TurkishVowelHarmony.pdf">Clements and Sezer</a>].</p>
<p>In phrases that is not dominated by the same syntactic node, this rounding harmony does not occur. For example, in a sentence like (1), one would expect “ikon” to be pronounced as [ykon] due to the presence of the adverb dün [dyn] prior to it, however, that is not the case. The same resistance is preserved even if we do not have this string in a place close to the topic area, the left-most phrases in Turkish sentences. The same resistance is still preserved if we place these two elements post-verbally, where they are produced in the same breadth, without a possible prosodic break.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Dün ikon aldım `I bought an icon yesterday’</li>
<li>Ben Ahmetlerin dükkanından dün ikon aldım. `I bought an icon yesterday from Ahmets’ store’</li>
<li>Ben Ahmetlerin dükkanından aldım dün ikon. `I bought an icon yesterday from Ahmets’ store’</li>
</ol>
<p>This is exactly the quadrant that Kate’s asymmetry says should be empty: co-articulation is supposed to be gradient and unrestricted, phonology is supposed to be categorical and morphological. Turkish gives you a phenomenon that’s both gradient but restricted.</p>
<p>My worry is that the two-level carve—categorical vs gradient, phonology vs phonetics—is just too strong. If phonology is supposed to be categorical and morphologically restricted, and phonetics gradient and unrestricted, what do we do with Turkish? Calling it “just coarticulation” ignores the morphological conditioning. Calling it “phonology” ignores the gradient, variable character.</p>
<p>Maybe I’m misunderstanding Kate’s point—her claim is typological, and she might be perfectly happy calling Turkish an outlier. But it makes me uneasy. Two-level models are good at drawing clean lines, and that’s why they’re attractive. But reality doesn’t always honor the bins we set up for it. One possibility is that coarticulation might be systematically governed prosodical structure. As of now, I categorize this in terms of nouns and their modifiers. It is possible that this is generalized to other heads and their modifiers. Then the question would be the following: is this rounding-harmony conditioned by prosodical structure that is a by-product of “head-modifier” relation or is it conditioned by syntactic locality?</p>
<!-- Insert closing side-by-side Praat spectrograms: one “positive” case (e.g. *ikon* → [ykon]) and one “negative” case (e.g. *nilüfer*), to visually show the subtle but systematic difference. -->

<section id="introduction" class="level1">
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>We have our data from PCIbex and our zip files from the server. Let’s assume we have unzipped them and converted them from <code>.webm</code> to <code>.wav</code> files. Now, it’s time to align them using MFA. But before that, we need to prepare our files accordingly. Here are the steps we will follow in this document:</p>
<ul>
<li>Load the PCIbex results</li>
<li>Filter out irrelevant sound files</li>
<li>Move all of our <code>.wav</code> and <code>.TextGrid</code> files to the same directory</li>
<li>Rename our files according to MFA guidelines</li>
<li>Run MFA</li>
<li>Create a dataframe</li>
</ul>
<p>Before we start, let me load my favorite packages. The <code>library()</code> function loads the packages we need, assuming they are already installed. If not, use the <code>install.packages()</code> function to install them. While <code>library()</code> does not require quotes, you should use quotes with <code>install.packages()</code>, e.g., <code>install.packages("tidyverse")</code>. If it asks you to select a mirror from a list, choose a location geographically close to you, such as the UK.</p>

<h1>PCIbex Results</h1>
<section id="read-the-results" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="read-the-results">Read the results</h2>
<p>The main reason we are loading PCIbex results is because sometimes we use the <code>async()</code> function in our PCIbex code. The <code>async()</code> function allows us to send recordings to our server whenever we want without waiting for the end of the experiment. Even though it is extremely helpful in reducing some of the server-PCIbex connection load at the end of the experiment, it also creates some pesky situations. For example, if a participant decides not to complete their experiment, we will still end up with some of their recordings. We do not want participants who were window-shopping, mainly because we are not sure about the quality of their data. Luckily for us, PCIbex only saves the results of participants who complete the entire experiment.</p>
<p>To read the PCIbex results, we are going to use the function provided in the <a href="https://doc.pcibex.net/advanced-tutorial/12_examining-data.html">PCIbex documentation</a>. Scroll down on that page, and you will see the words “Click for Base R Version.” The function is provided there as well. Moreover, please be careful whenever you are copying and pasting functions from this file, or any file, as sometimes PDF or HTML files can include unwanted elements, like a page number.</p>

<p>After checking my <code>Value</code> column where the file names for <code>MediaRecorder</code> are stored, I realize that this will not be enough given that we still have other unwanted elements like <code>test-recorder.webm</code> file or some practice files. There are multiple ways to get rid of these files, and you have to think about how to get rid of them for your own specific dataframe. For my own data, I will filter my data utilizing the labels I provided in my PCIbex code. They are stored in the <code>Labels</code> column. What I want is to only get the <code>MediaRecorders</code> that are within a trial whose label starts with the word <code>trial</code>.</p>
<p>You may have coded your data differently; you may have used a different word; you may not even have any practice or test-recorders, so maybe you do not even need this second filtering. Check your dataframe using the <code>View()</code> function. I am also using a function called <code>str_detect()</code>, which detects a regular expression pattern, in this case <code>^trial</code>, meaning starting with the word trial. Now, when I check my dataframe, I will only see experimental trials and recordings related to those trials. Just to make sure, I am also using the <code>unique()</code> function so that I do not have repetitions. And, I am assigning my filenames to a list called <code>ibex_files</code>. You can see that any random sample with the <code>sample()</code> function will give filenames related to experimental trials.</p>

<h1>Filtering Files from the Server</h1>
<p>Now that we have a <em>gold list</em>, we can go ahead and filter our files from the server according to our gold list, based on the results from PCIbex. To do this, first we will create a temporary folder called <code>gold</code>. We will strip every file name of its extension <code>.wav</code> or <code>.TextGrid</code> and check if that name exists in our <em>gold list</em>. If that is the case, we will move the file. To this end, we are going to use something called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zOTJ0fOllI"><em>for loops</em></a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6E_qqhwr7M"><em>if statements</em></a>. You can click on the hyperlinks to watch more on them. <sup>1</sup></p>
<ul>
<li>First, we need to list all of our files. I have all my <code>.wav</code> and <code>.TextGrid</code> files in the same place, so I just need to list a single directory. You might have them in different places. Check the commented-out part. To only get relevant files, I am using a regular expression saying only choose the ones that end (<code>$</code>) with <code>.wav</code> or (<code>|</code>) <code>.TextGrid</code> using the pattern argument.</li>
<li>Second, we create our <em>gold directory</em> with the <code>dir.create()</code> function.</li>
<li>Third, we iterate over every file in the files list, get its name without its extension using the <code>tools::file_path_sans_ext()</code> function and check whether it exists in our <em>gold list</em> using the <code>%in%</code> operator.</li>
<li>If it is also present in the gold list, we specify where the file exists and assign it to a variable called <code>old_file_path</code>. We also specify where it should be moved and assign it to a variable called <code>new_file_path</code>. We use the <code>file.path()</code> function and <code>dir</code>/<code>gold_dir</code> variables, along with the file <code>f</code> we are iterating over.</li>
<li>Lastly, we move the file using the <code>file.rename()</code> function. Even though the name of the function is <em>rename</em>, it can be used to move files. Every file exists with its pointer, such as <code>~/data/important.R</code>. By changing this pointer, we can change its name, as well as its location to something like <code>~/gold_data/really_important.R</code>. We did not only change the file name from important to really_important. We also changed other parts of this pointer, that is the folder part. If the folder <code>gold_data</code> exists, it will be moved there.</li>
<li>To make sure this for loop works, I also print a message after every file movement using the <code>cat()</code> function.</li>

<p>One important thing to note here is that if you have your <code>.wav</code> and <code>.TextGrid</code> files in different directories, you can either manually move them to a single folder using your file management application. Alternatively, you can run the commands above using <code>wav_dir</code> and <code>tg_dir</code> variables, along with <code>tg_files</code> and <code>wav_files</code> variables. It should look like the following. There are, of course, better ways to solve this problem, and I leave that to your creativity.</p>

<h1>Renaming Files</h1>
<p>This section is going to be the section you have to be most careful about. If you mess anything up in this section, you will have to delete everything, go back, unzip your files, convert them to <code>.wav</code> from <code>.webm</code>, and do everything in this file again. So, before giving you the for-loop to rename all files, I want to make sure that we go over one of the files and make sure we do it correctly.</p>
<p>The main reason we rename our files is because we want Montreal Forced Aligner to understand that we have multiple speakers in our dataset. If we do not do that, it will treat all files as if they are from a single speaker and probably will be very confused due to inter-speaker variance in speech. Since we have erroneously specified in our PCIbex files to use the <code>subject_id</code> as a suffix rather than a prefix, we have to fix that. If in the future we fix that in our PCIbex script, we do not have to go over this part.</p>
<section id="one-file-example" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="one-file-example">One-file example</h2>
<p>My files, after unzipping, converting to <code>.wav</code>, and filtering according to the gold list, look like the following. There are some important things to keep in mind here. First of all, now that everything is in our <em>gold directory</em>, we have to use the <code>gold_dir</code> variable to list our files. Secondly, we again need to use the pattern argument to make sure we only select relevant files. The last thing to be aware of in the next code is that I am using indexing with square brackets to refer to the first elements in the list. I will use this element to first ensure that what I am doing is correct.</p>

<p>Now that we have the name of an example file, we can start by extracting its extension. We will use the function <code>file_ext</code> from the package called <code>tools</code>. Sometimes, we do not want to load an entire package, but we want to access a single function. In those cases, we use the operator <code>::</code>. Additionally, we will use <code>paste0</code> to prefix the extension with a dot, so that we can use it later when we rename our files.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="get-the-subject-id">Get the subject id</h3>
<p>Now, the most important part is getting the subject name. If you look at what my <code>rest</code> variable returned, you can see that it consists of the last 4 characters, which are also the last set of characters after the last underscore. There are multiple ways to extract the subject id. I will show you both methods so that you can choose and adapt them for your own data. For the underscore version, we will use the function <code>str_split()</code>, and for the character counting, we will use <code>str_sub()</code>.</p>
<section id="underscore-approach" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="underscore-approach">Underscore approach</h4>
<p><code>str_split()</code> takes a string and splits it according to the separator you provide. In our case, the separator is the underscore. We are also using an additional argument called <code>simplify</code> to make the resulting elements more user-friendly. Our function now returns a small table with 1 row and 5 columns. To select the values in the 5th column, we use square brackets again, this time with a comma. When you apply this approach to your own data, remember that you may end up with fewer or more than 5 columns depending on your naming convention. Be sure to adjust the column number accordingly. It might also be the case that your subject id is not stored last or that your separators are not underscores but simple “-”. Modify the code according to your specific needs.</p>

</div>
<p>Lastly, we have to modify the <code>rest</code> variable so that we do not include the subject id twice. I will use the same approach again. After obtaining the table, I will use the <code>paste()</code> function to concatenate the columns back together with the underscore separator. Adjust the number of columns used in this function and the separator according to your own data needs.</p>

<p><code>str_sub()</code> allows you to extract a substring using indices. In my case, the subject id is the last four characters. To refer to characters from the end, you can use the minus symbol <code>-</code>.

<p>At this point, we have everything we need: (i) the subject id prefix, (ii) the rest of our file name, and (iii) the extension. Now, we need to combine all of this together. We are going to use the <code>paste0()</code> function. Remember, this function is different from <code>paste()</code>. The main difference is that with <code>paste0()</code>, we cannot specify separators; we have to provide everything. This might seem like a disadvantage at first, but it is beneficial for non-pattern cases like this.</p>

We also need to obtain the full path of our <code>example_file</code>. We can achieve this easily using the <code>file.path</code> function again.</p>

<p>After running this, make sure the naming convention is as we want. Check your folder by searching for the trial. It should look something like <code>subj_rest.wav</code> or <code>subj_rest.TextGrid</code>. In my case, it is `<code>, where</code>dltc` is my subject id or subj.</p>

<p>I know that some of your files look like the following: <code>squid_S_jtfr.wav</code>. Here, I will provide you with the code to rename this. Please check this code before using it.

<p>Now, I am going to put all the code together in one chunk, except for moving. Also, be aware that I am using my own <code>gold_dir</code>; please specify yours according to your needs. Additionally, be mindful of your operating system (Windows or Mac). If you are using Windows, your <code>gold_dir</code> variable should look like the second line.

<h1>Running the Montreal Forced Aligner</h1>
<p>Now that we have our files in the format we want, we can place all of our files in the MFA folder and start running the aligner. We can either move our files using the Explorer app and usual copy-paste or we can use the <code>file.rename()</code> function again. Due to the aligner’s limitations, the second option is far better. The main constraint is that MFA starts encountering problems when we feed it more than 2000 files at once. Since I have a lot of data, I will use the following function to divide my files and move them into smaller subfolders. But before that, I will show you how to move files without dividing them into subfolders.</p>

<p>After moving the files either with code or by hand to a specific MFA folder, <code>~/Documents/MFA</code>, we can start running the terminal commands. At this point, I assume you have gone through the <a href="https://montreal-forced-aligner.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html">MFA documentation</a> for installation instructions. I am also assuming that you have used a <code>conda</code> environment. If you haven’t, here are the 3 lines to install MFA.</p>

<p>There are again two ways to do this. One way is to open your Terminal app or use the Terminal tab in the R console below. The other way, which I prefer more, is to execute commands using the R function <code>system()</code>. I will first go over the easier one, which is using the Terminal app or the Terminal tab in R. But the reason I prefer the <code>system()</code> function is that I can loop over multiple folders more easily that way, and I do not have to run my commands again and again.</p>
<section id="using-terminal" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="using-terminal">Using Terminal</h3>
<p>The first command we want to run is the conda environment code. Following the MFA documentation, I renamed my environment to <code>aligner</code>. So, I start by activating that environment.</p>

</div>
<p>After activating the environment, I need to download three models: (i) an acoustic model to recognize phonemes given previous and following acoustic features, (ii) a dictionary to access pretrained phone-word mappings, and (iii) a g2p model to generate sequences of phones based on orthography. For all of these models, we are going to use the <code>english_us_arpa</code> model. You can visit <a href="https://mfa-models.readthedocs.io/en/latest/acoustic/index.html">this website</a> to explore various languages and models.</p>

</div>
<p>After downloading these models, we are going to validate our corpus. There are many customizable parameters for this step. You can check them <a href="https://montreal-forced-aligner.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/data_validation.html">here</a>. I am going to use my favorite settings here. You can interpret the following command like this: <em>Dear Montreal Forced Aligner (<code>mfa</code>), can you please analyze my files located in <code>~/Documents/MFA/mycorpus</code> and <code>validate</code> them using the <code>english_us_arpa</code> acoustic model and <code>english_us_arpa</code> dictionary? Please also consider that I have multiple speakers, indicated by the first 4 characters (<code>-s 4</code>). It would be great to use multiprocessing (<code>--use_mp</code>) for faster execution. Lastly, please clean up previous and new temporary files (<code>--clean --final_clean</code>).</em></p>

<p>This process will take some time. Afterward, you will have some <em>out of vocabulary</em> words found in your TextGrids. You can easily create new pronunciations for them and add them to your model.</p>
<p>The <code>mfa g2p</code> command can take many arguments; here I am using only three. First, the path to the text file that has <em>out of vocabulary</em> words. This file is automatically created in your folder where your files are located. The path may vary depending on your system and folder naming, but the name of the <code>.txt</code> file will be the same. In my case, it is <code>~/Documents/MFA/mycorpus/oovs_found_english_us_arpa.txt</code>. The second argument is the name of the g2p model. As you may recall, we downloaded it earlier, and its name is <code>english_us_arpa</code>. Finally, the third argument is the path to a target <code>.txt</code> file to store new pronunciations. I would like to store them in the same place, so I am using the following path: <code>~/Documents/MFA/mycorpus/g2pped_oovs.txt</code>.</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="code-copy-outer-scaffold"><div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb33" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode bash code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb33-1"><span class="ex" style="color: null;

</div>
<p>After creating the pronunciations, you can add them to your model with <code>mfa model add_words</code>. This command takes the name of the dictionary as an argument (<code>english_us_arpa</code>) and the output of the <code>mfa g2p</code> command, which was a <code>.txt</code> file storing pronunciations: <code>~/Documents/MFA/mycorpus/g2pped_oovs.txt</code>.</p>

</div>
<p>The last step is the alignment process. It will align (<code>mfa align</code>) the words and the phones inside our TextGrids stored in <code>~/Documents/MFA/mycorpus</code> using our previously downloaded dictionary (<code>english_us_arpa</code>) and model (<code>english_us_arpa</code>), and store the newly aligned TextGrids in a new folder called <code>~/Documents/MFA/output</code>.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="using-r">Using R</h3>
<p>We can also accomplish all of this in R. One advantage of this approach is that it allows us to iterate over multiple subfolders more easily, which can be useful if we have more than 2000 files. We will use four components:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li><code>system()</code> function to execute terminal commands,</li>
<li><code>paste()</code> function to create multiline templates,</li>
<li><code>%s</code> string placeholder to create template codes,</li>
<li><code>sprintf()</code> function to format our templates.</li>
</ol>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction-to-sprintf-and-s">Introduction to <code>sprintf()</code> and <code>%s</code></h4>
<p>Before going further with MFA codes, let me illustrate with an example. Suppose we have a list of folder names, and we want to create a <code>.txt</code> file in each of these folders. We can use the <code>system()</code> function to perform this action. Below, I define my <code>folder_list</code>, then create paths for my <code>.txt</code> files in each folder, such as <code>~/data1/mydocument.txt</code>. Afterwards, I generate a list of commands to create these files using <code>touch</code>, which is a command-line tool for creating files. Finally, I execute these commands using the <code>system()</code> function.</p>

<p>This approach becomes particularly useful when dealing with multiple placeholders within the same command. For instance, the command template will replace the first <code>%s</code> with the first argument, such as <code>~/data1</code>, and the second <code>%s</code> with the second argument, like <code>mydoc1</code>, when formatted using <code>sprintf()</code>.</p>

<p>Next, we’ll consolidate the previous code by concatenating it using <code>paste()</code> and separating commands with <code>;</code>. If needed, we’ll incorporate placeholders. Each line will be assigned to a new variable, and then they’ll be combined into a single command string using <code>paste()</code>. Finally, we’ll execute the command string using <code>system()</code> with the argument <code>intern = TRUE</code> to capture the output into an R variable, which allows for later inspection.</p>

<p>After initializing the model, the next step involves validation. Again, I’ll use the same approach and concatenate the commands together. However, sometimes we may have too many files and need to use subfolders. To accommodate this, I’ll use <code>%s</code> placeholders. The validation command has one placeholder for different subfolders. Similarly, our pronunciation creation for g2p has two placeholders, though they’ll be filled with the same value. Lastly, the <code>add_words</code> command will use a single placeholder. Fortunately, all these folders are the same, so we can reuse the same variable repeatedly.</p>

<p>Since this step takes longer and there’s more room for errors, I want to save all my outputs in a list. First, I need to identify which folders exist in my MFA directory.

<p>Now you can check the outputs by calling specific variables like <code>output_val_s1</code> or <code>output_val_s2</code>. After this step, the only task remaining is to run the aligner. We will create a template again, iterate over folders, and assign outputs to their respective names for verification. Meanwhile, the bash code will execute in the background. This time, our placeholders will refer to different inputs and an output folder. Fortunately, we can use the same output folder for every subfolder, so instead of using two placeholders, we’ll use a single <code>%s</code> placeholder.</p>

<p>In this project, which involves aligning words, we are interested in only a couple of these columns. Specifically, we focus on the file identifier (<code>file</code>) to determine the trial from which the data originates, the tier name (<code>tier_name</code>) to differentiate between word and phone tiers, the start (<code>xmin</code>) and end (<code>xmax</code>) of each interval, and finally, the <code>text</code>. Additionally, I am not interested in retaining the file extension in the <code>file</code> identifier. Therefore, we will first filter to include only annotated words, then select the important columns using <code>select()</code>, remove the <code>.TextGrid</code> extension, and concatenate the words so that we can see the full response for each trial.</p>

<p>We also need some information about the trial. Luckily, all of our information is provided in our file name. So, I am going to parse that name to create a dataframe with more information. I am using a set of function that all start with <code>separate_wider_</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>delim</code> version uses a deliminator to split a row of a dataframe.</li>
<li>The <code>regex</code> version uses regular expressions to split the data.</li>
<li>Finally, the <code>position</code> version uses the number of characters to split the data.</li>
</ul>
<p>I am doing all of this because of how I initially coded my experiment output in my PCIbex script. You may need to change this code to process your own data.</p>

<p>Let’s see what you will need to do. You will find your file in the <code>MFA/output</code> folder as well, and your file will look like <code>jtfr_squid_S.TextGrid</code>. Let’s arbitrarily put them here. Remember, you will have to use the <code>file.list()</code> function as well. You will not need to change anything in the first part where we work on the TextGrid. The necessary changes will need to be done in the parsing procedure. Instead of using the entire <code>regex</code> or <code>position</code> methods, you will just need to use the <code>delim</code> version of the function.</p>

<p>Now, we need to apply this process to all files in our output directory. To simplify this, I’ll start by creating a function for processing each file individually and then apply it to all files. The function takes a file name and its directory as inputs and returns a dataframe. Before creating each dataframe, it prints “Reading the file.” to indicate progress.</p>

<p>Now, we need to integrate this function into our for-loop. Instead of using a single file like <code>file_list[1]</code>, we will apply it to an entire directory. Unlike previous for loops, we will use the <code>map</code> function from the <code>purrr</code> package. It is faster and easier to use in cases like this. <code>map()</code> will return all of our dataframes embedded in a list. After using <code>map()</code>, we need to combine all these smaller dataframes into a larger one using <code>bind_rows</code>.</p>

<h1>An Example Descriptive Summary</h1>
<p>Let me also show a small example of descriptive statistics using basic functions. One thing we might want to do is check whether there is a difference between conditions in people’s time to start uttering the sentence. Let’s assume people are still thinking about the sentence when they utter the first determiner “<em>the</em>,” since it is kind of automatic in English and all of our sentences start with this determiner anyway. I am going to filter my dataframe using the <code>text</code> column. Additionally, I want to ensure it is the first occurrence of “<em>the</em>” and not any other “<em>the</em>” in the sentences, so I will use the <code>annotation_num</code> column in my filtering.</p>
<div class="cell">

</div>
<p>Then, what I am going to do is summarize my dataframe. I will group my dataframe by columns <code>verb_type</code> and <code>sem_type</code> since my experiment had 2 different verb types (unergative, unaccusative) and 2 different types of semantic distractors (related, unrelated). Then, I am going to use the <code>summarize()</code> function to get the mean, standard error, and credible interval for each condition. Since we are assuming people are still planning sentences while they utter the first determiner, I am going to summarize my data using the offset of the <em>the</em> (<code>xmax</code>). Before doing this, I am going to convert <code>xmax</code> from seconds to milliseconds.</p>

  <title>automating experimental recording management with bash</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>I realized that most of my experimental time was being eaten up not by designing or running studies, but by the tedious task of downloading recordings from the server, unzipping them, converting formats, and filing them into the right participant folders. After a while, the frustration of repeating these steps by hand turned into procrastination and that procrastination produced some bash scripts to automate the whole process.</p>

<p>Finally, within each participant’s folder, I move the recordings into two buckets: - <code>fam/</code> for habituation (familiarization) files (those with <em>fam</em>), - <code>misc/</code> for practice, intro, and test files.</p>
<p>I use <code>nullglob</code> to avoid errors if a folder doesn’t contain a certain file type.</p>

<p>What started as procrastination ended up saving me hours of repetitive work. Probably, it is not a good code, but it turns file management into a background task and leaves more time to me for the actual science. If you have any comments how to make the code better, please reach out!</p>

  <title>agreement attraction in turkish</title>
  <dc:creator>Utku Turk</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.utkuturk.com/posts/ma-thesis/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>The term agreement attraction is used to describe either increased acceptability of ungrammatical sentences or reduced difficulty in reading ungrammatical sentences. This was made possible by an illusionary element which matches with the features of the verb, thus attracting the probe of the agreement from the head noun to itself. <br> <br> Consider the following sentence: “*The key to the cabinets are rusty.” Even though it is ungrammatical, people systematically accepted these sentences more often than the ones with the word “attractor.” They also spend less time when there is a plural nominal like “cabinets” rather than the word “cabinet.” <br> <br> This thesis tries to explore how the attraction phenomenon interacts with issues like case syncretism, form heuristics, response bias, and register, all of which are rarely investigated in the literature. This thesis also provides an extensive, but not exhaustive, picture of attraction effects in Turkish, an understudied language in psycholinguistics.</p>

<p>In this thesis, I investigate the existing agreement attraction effects in Turkish and how these effects interact with various phenomenon such as (i) case syncretism and local ambiguity, (ii) form heuristics, (iii) response bias, and (iv) honorific readings. Previous studies have shown that speakers occasionally find ungrammatical sentences violating number agreement acceptable when there is another noun sharing same number with the verb, in other words exhibited agreement attraction. Lago et al.&nbsp;(2019) found that genitive-possessive structures were able to induce agreement attraction effects within native Turkish speakers in a speeded acceptability experiment. However, due to the nature of the Turkish and acceptability studies, there are multiple alternative explanations for the existing effects. This thesis aims to weed out possible confounds and clarify the effects by conducting four speeded acceptability judgment experiments. We showed (i) that case-ambiguity on the head noun does not play a role in Turkish agreement attraction (Experiment 1, N = 118), (ii) that participants do not use form-driven-processing-strategies to answer judgment questions (Experiments 2A, N = 80, and 2B, N = 95), (iii) that response bias induced ungrammaticality illusion and only decreased the magnitude of grammaticality illusion (Experiment 3, N = 114), and (iv) that a possible honorific reading does not license superfluous plural marking at the verb (Experiment 4, N = 174). Together, our results challenge cue-based retrieval accounts of agreement attraction and can be accommodated by accounts that assume attraction occurs due to erroneous encodings.</p>

  <title>is /j/ really a sonorant in turkish? i guess not.</title>
  <dc:creator>Utku Turk</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.utkuturk.com/posts/j-glide/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>This work started as a term paper for our master’s phonology class with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/semra-özdemir-6567b6155/">Semra Ozdemir</a>. She was interested in the properties of sonorants and I was interested in the phonetics of them. We saw that in many environments Turkish glide /j/ acts differently than other sonorants. The fact that /j/ was the only phonemic glide in Turkish was already interesting by itself. We asked the following question: <strong>Is it really a glide?</strong></p>
<p>We looked at certain phonological behaviors of the /j/: (i) /h/ deletion prior to sonorants, (ii) consonant-clusters in coda, and (iii) [e]-lowering prior to sonorants. We also conducted a phonetics experiment where we asked people to read sentences that contains sonorants in word-final, word-initial, and intervocalic positions following the sound [e]. Our results from this experiment can be seen in the figure below.</p>
<center>
<img src="https://www.utkuturk.com/posts/j-glide/glide_fig.png" alt="<i>Figure 1.</i> F1 and F2 values of individual utterances of the mid-front vowel e.We grouped these instances into two: following /j/ or following a non-/j/ sound." width="85%">
<p class="caption">
<i>Figure 1.</i> F1 and F2 values of individual utterances of the mid-front vowel e.We grouped these instances into two: following /j/ or following a non-/j/ sound.
</p>
</center>
<p>We saw that /j/ behaves nothing like a sonorant. When the sound /j/ follows the mid-front vowel [e], it did not lower the vowel. However, every other sonorant (non-/j/) substantially lowered the vowel. Even though, it is clear that /j/ does not act like a sonorant, we were indecisive whether it were unspecified with respect to its sonoracy or it was just a fricative.</p>
<p>Later on, <a href="https://linguistics.boun.edu.tr/stefano-canalis">Stefano Canalis</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ümit-can-tunçer-b97479b2/">Umit Tuncer</a> also joined us in this project. With their help, we decided that /j/ is a phonemically fricative in Turkish, but may show sonorant-like behavior in certain environments. With them, we looked at the phonemic behavior of /j/ in more environments. We also investigated the feature symmetry in Turkish.</p>
<p>We saw that other phonetic sonorants in Turkish were also phonemically fricative and /j/ and other sonorants become sonorant-like in the very same environments.</p>

  <title>can ‘as if’ clauses be degree comparisons?</title>
  <dc:creator>Utku Turk</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.utkuturk.com/posts/as-if/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p><img src="https://www.utkuturk.com/posts/as-if/dancing.jpg" class="preview-image img-fluid"></p>
<p>After reading <a href="https://www.jbledin.com/papers">Justin Bledin’s</a> work on English <em>as ifs</em>, we realized that Turkish counterparts of <em>as ifs</em> behave differently. It seemed that instead of a simple comparison of events, Turkish <em>as ifs</em> seems to be susceptible to <strong>gradability</strong> and <strong>degree</strong>.</p>
<p>To account for Turkish facts, we proposed that a novel analysis of these sentences. While previous accounts were based on event similarity, our hypothesis is based on comparing degrees of gradable elements involved in the event.</p>
<p>Consider this sentence: Pedro was dancing as if he was possessed by a demon. And, let’s take a look at the interpretations in (1) and (2). (1) is the simplified version of previous accounts. The key word for those analyses is the resemblance. On the other hand, (2) is our account in a simplified manner. Instead of using resemblance, we proposed an equatative approach. Our analysis compares two degrees of adverbials.</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="cell-output-display">
<ol class="example" type="1">
<li>Pedro’s dancing in the actual world resembles his dancing in other possible worlds where he is possessed by a demon.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="cell-output-display">
<ol start="2" class="example" type="1">
<li>The level of craziness of Pedro’s dancing in the actual world is ≥ the level of craziness of his dancing in other possible worlds where he is possessed by a demon.</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<p>Here’s the facts that support our analysis:</p>

<p>The distribution of -mışcasına clauses shows that Turkish “as if” does not simply signal resemblance between two events, but rather compares the degree of gradable properties across possible worlds. This degree-based perspective explains why such clauses pattern with adverbials and adjectives that admit gradability, and why they fail in contexts that already contain competing degree operators.</p>

  <title>how to include r expressions in (quarto) yaml</title>
  <dc:creator>Utku Turk</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.utkuturk.com/posts/yaml-rnotebook/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>When writing R Markdown or Quarto files, I’ve always disliked cluttering them with long file paths, fixed parameters, or small snippets of code. Many of these values are constants or things I don’t plan to change often, sometimes not even across projects. So I started looking for a way to move such information into a separate YAML file and refer to it from within Quarto. You could of course do this with a regular R script and source(), but I found that YAML makes these kinds of project-wide parameters easier to organize and read.</p>
<section id="embedding-r-in-yaml" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="embedding-r-in-yaml">Embedding R in YAML</h2>
<p>While digging around, I came across <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64454623/r-read-yaml-reads-a-vector-as-parameter">this helpful StackOverflow post</a>, which pointed out that YAML can evaluate R expressions directly if marked with !expr. This means your config file can contain values that are not just static strings, but dynamically computed.</p>
<p>For example, my <code>_paper.yaml</code> file looks like this:</p>
<div class="code-copy-outer-scaffold"><div class="sourceCode" id="cb1" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode yaml code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode yaml"><span id="cb1-1"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">experiments</span><span class="kw" style="color: #003B4F;
background-color: null;
font-weight: bold;
font-style: inherit;">:</span></span>
<span id="cb1-2"><span class="at" style="color: #657422;
background-color: null;

<p>To load the config file, you just need to enable expression evaluation when calling <code>yaml::read_yaml()</code>:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="code-copy-outer-scaffold"><div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb2" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb2-1">config <span class="ot" style="color: #003B4F;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">&lt;-</span> yaml<span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">::</span><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">read_yaml</span>(<span class="st" style="color: #20794D;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">'_paper.yaml'</span>, <span class="at" style="color: #657422;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">eval.expr =</span> <span class="cn" style="color: #8f5902;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">TRUE</span>)</span></code></pre></div></div>
</div>
<p>Now, config behaves like a nested list, and you can access parameters directly. For example:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="code-copy-outer-scaffold"><div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb3" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb3-1">config<span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">$</span>experiments<span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">$</span>first</span>
<span id="cb3-2">config<span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">$</span>experiments<span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">$</span>first<span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">$</span>nsubject</span></code></pre></div></div>
</div>
<p>This makes it easy to centralize all project-level constants and keep your Quarto documents cleaner.</p>

<section id="why-this-helps" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-this-helps">Why This Helps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Cleaner documents: no repeated paths or magic numbers in your <code>.qmd</code> files.</li>
<li>Reusability: the same YAML file can be shared across multiple projects.</li>
<li>Flexibility: values can be static (like participant counts) or computed on the fly (like paths that depend on the username).</li>
</ul>
<p>It might feel a little fragile, since I am evaluating R code hidden in a config file, but it’s been reliable and I am finding it quite useful. For instance, I sometimes even compute the number of participants automatically from an Ibex CSV and store it in the YAML—then refer to it in my Quarto text.</p>

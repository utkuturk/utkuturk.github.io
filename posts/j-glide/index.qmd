description: findings point to a fricative status for /j/, despite its occasional sonorant disguise

This work started as a term paper for our master’s phonology class with
[Semra Ozdemir](https://www.linkedin.com/in/semra-özdemir-6567b6155/).
She was interested in the properties of sonorants and I was interested
in the phonetics of them. We saw that in many environments Turkish glide
/j/ acts differently than other sonorants. The fact that /j/ was the
only phonemic glide in Turkish was already interesting by itself. We
asked the following question: **Is it really a glide?**

We looked at certain phonological behaviors of the /j/: (i) /h/ deletion
prior to sonorants, (ii) consonant-clusters in coda, and (iii)
\[e\]-lowering prior to sonorants. We also conducted a phonetics
experiment where we asked people to read sentences that contains
sonorants in word-final, word-initial, and intervocalic positions
following the sound \[e\]. Our results from this experiment can be seen
in the figure below.

We saw that /j/ behaves nothing like a sonorant. When the sound /j/
follows the mid-front vowel \[e\], it did not lower the vowel. However,
every other sonorant (non-/j/) substantially lowered the vowel. Even
though, it is clear that /j/ does not act like a sonorant, we were
indecisive whether it were unspecified with respect to its sonoracy or
it was just a fricative.

Later on, [Stefano
Canalis](https://linguistics.boun.edu.tr/stefano-canalis) and [Umit
Tuncer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ümit-can-tunçer-b97479b2/) also
joined us in this project. With their help, we decided that /j/ is a
phonemically fricative in Turkish, but may show sonorant-like behavior
in certain environments. With them, we looked at the phonemic behavior
of /j/ in more environments. We also investigated the feature symmetry
in Turkish.

We saw that other phonetic sonorants in Turkish were also phonemically
fricative and /j/ and other sonorants become sonorant-like in the very
same environments.

My research investigates how different kinds of linguistic information—morphosyntactic structure and morphophonological form—are planned in production and retrieved during sentence processing, and how mismatches between them drive errors and create illusions in production and comprehension. I also work in formal properties of case and adjectival morphophonology, as well as question semantics and embedding facts.\n      \n      \n        I recently visited UMass to work with Shota Momma and Faruk Akkus. Previously, I received my MA from Boğaziçi University (advisor: Pavel Logačev) and was a visiting researcher at Masaryk University (advisor: Pavel Caha).\n      \n      \n        My favorite food is gata with koritz and my favorite icecream flavor is saffron and rose (5pm snack of Anthony Bourdain).

Superordinate primes can facilitate or interfere.\nMid (-150ms): Lemma selection is occurring. This is when semantic competitors cause maximum interference.\nLate (+300ms): Phonological encoding is active. Sound-similar words interfere at this stage.\n\n\n\nKey Findings in the Literature\n\nSemantic interference peaks around SOA -150ms to 0ms (Schriefers et al., 1990)\nPhonological facilitation typically occurs at positive SOAs (Starreveld, 2000)\nSuperordinate interference can occur at very early SOAs (Vitkovitch & Tyrrell, 1999)\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nSchriefers, H., Meyer, A.

Many of these values are constants or things I don’t plan to change often, sometimes not even across projects. So I started looking for a way to move such information into a separate YAML file and refer to it from within Quarto. You could of course do this with a regular R script and source(), but I found that YAML makes these kinds of project-wide parameters easier to organize and read."

    "section": "",
    "text": "After reading Justin Bledin’s work on English as ifs, we realized that Turkish counterparts of as ifs behave differently. It seemed that instead of a simple comparison of events, Turkish as ifs seems to be susceptible to gradability and degree.\nTo account for Turkish facts, we proposed that a novel analysis of these sentences. While previous accounts were based on event similarity, our hypothesis is based on comparing degrees of gradable elements involved in the event.\nConsider this sentence: Pedro was dancing as if he was possessed by a demon. And, let’s take a look at the interpretations in (1) and (2). (1) is the simplified version of previous accounts. The key word for those analyses is the resemblance. On the other hand, (2) is our account in a simplified manner. Instead of using resemblance, we proposed an equatative approach. Our analysis compares two degrees of adverbials.\n\n\n\nPedro’s dancing in the actual world resembles his dancing in other possible worlds where he is possessed by a demon.\n\n\n\n\nThe level of craziness of Pedro’s dancing in the actual world is ≥ the level of craziness of his dancing in other possible worlds where he is possessed by a demon.\n\n\n\nHere’s the facts that support our analysis:\nUnlike English and German, Turkish does not have an overt conditional marker in as ifs constructions.\n\n\n\nPedro was dancing he was possessed by a demon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPedro içine cin kaç-mışcasına {dans ed-iyor-du}\n\n\nPedro inside jhin escape-HCM dance-IMPF-PST.3SG\n\n\n“Pedro was dancing as if he was possessed by a demon.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is frequently used with an adverbial in a matrix sentence with a verbal predicate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPedro içine cin kaç-mışcasına çılgınca {dans ed-iyor-du}\n\n\nPedro inside jhin escape-HCM crazily dance-IMPF-PST.3SG\n\n\n“Pedro was dancing as if he was possessed by a demon.”\n\n\n\n\n\nEven when there is no overt adverbial, the use of -mışcasına phrase necessitates an adverbial reading to be accessed from the context. When we use -mışcasına phrase in a sentence where there is no possible adverbial is available in the context, the sentence become infelicitous.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n\nYarın meteor yağ-acak-mışcasına dans ed-iyor-sun.\n\n\ntomorrow meteor rain-FUT-HCM dance-IMPF-2SG\n\n\n“You are dancing [???] as if there will be a meteor shower tomorrow.”\n\n\n\n\n\nMore importantly, these adverbs are always gradable adverbials. Similarly, when the matrix predicate is non-verbal, it has to be a gradable adjective.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHelin pandemi bit-mişcesine mutlu.\n\n\nHelin pandemic end-HCM happy.3SG\n\n\n“Helin is happy as if the pandemic is over.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n\nCevab-ı soru-yu duy-ma-mışcasına yanlış-tı .\n\n\nanswer-POSS.3SG question-ACC hear-NEG-HCM wrong-PST.3SG\n\n\n“Intended: His answer was wrong as if he did not hear the question.”\n\n\n\n\n\nLastly, when there is an already established degree-related operation, we cannot use -mışcasına phrases. This is similar to the cases where we cannot use two degree operators most and more at the same time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMecidiyeköy cehennem-mışcesine kalabalık bir ilçe-miz-dir.\n\n\nMecidiyeköy hell-HCM crowded a district-POSS.1PL-AOR\n\n\n“Mecidiyeköy is a crowded district as if it was hell.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n\nMecidiyeköy cehennem-mışcesine en kalabalık ilçe-miz-dir.\n\n\nMecidiyeköy hell-HCM most crowded district-POSS.1PL-AOR\n\n\n“Intended: Mecidiyeköy is the most crowded district as if it was hell.”\n\n\n\n\n\nThe distribution of -mışcasına clauses shows that Turkish “as if” does not simply signal resemblance between two events, but rather compares the degree of gradable properties across possible worlds. This degree-based perspective explains why such clauses pattern with adverbials and adjectives that admit gradability, and why they fail in contexts that already contain competing degree operators."

    "text": "Read the results\nThe main reason we are loading PCIbex results is because sometimes we use the async() function in our PCIbex code. The async() function allows us to send recordings to our server whenever we want without waiting for the end of the experiment. Even though it is extremely helpful in reducing some of the server-PCIbex connection load at the end of the experiment, it also creates some pesky situations. For example, if a participant decides not to complete their experiment, we will still end up with some of their recordings. We do not want participants who were window-shopping, mainly because we are not sure about the quality of their data. Luckily for us, PCIbex only saves the results of participants who complete the entire experiment.\nTo read the PCIbex results, we are going to use the function provided in the PCIbex documentation. Scroll down on that page, and you will see the words “Click for Base R Version.” The function is provided there as well. Moreover, please be careful whenever you are copying and pasting functions from this file, or any file, as sometimes PDF or HTML files can include unwanted elements, like a page number.\n\n# User-defined function to read in PCIbex Farm results files\nread.pcibex &lt;- function(\n    filepath, \n    auto.colnames=TRUE, \n    fun.col=\\(col,cols){cols[cols==col]&lt;-paste(col,\"Ibex\",sep=\".\");return(cols)}\n    ) {\n  n.cols &lt;- max(count.fields(filepath,sep=\",\",quote=NULL),na.rm=TRUE)\n  if (auto.colnames){\n    cols &lt;- c()\n    con &lt;- file(filepath, \"r\")\n    while ( TRUE ) {\n      line &lt;- readLines(con, n = 1, warn=FALSE)\n      if ( length(line) == 0) {\n        break\n      }\n      m &lt;- regmatches(line,regexec(\"^# (\\\\d+)\\\\.

Check your dataframe using the View() function. I am also using a function called str_detect(), which detects a regular expression pattern, in this case ^trial, meaning starting with the word trial. Now, when I check my dataframe, I will only see experimental trials and recordings related to those trials. Just to make sure, I am also using the unique() function so that I do not have repetitions.

    "text": "One-file example\nMy files, after unzipping, converting to .wav, and filtering according to the gold list, look like the following. There are some important things to keep in mind here. First of all, now that everything is in our gold directory, we have to use the gold_dir variable to list our files. Secondly, we again need to use the pattern argument to make sure we only select relevant files. The last thing to be aware of in the next code is that I am using indexing with square brackets to refer to the first elements in the list. I will use this element to first ensure that what I am doing is correct.\n\ngold_dir &lt;- \"~/data/gold\"\nfiles &lt;- list.files(gold_dir, pattern = \"\\\\.wav$|\\\\.TextGrid$\")\nexample_file &lt;- files[1]\nexample_file\n\n\nGet the extension and the name\nNow that we have the name of an example file, we can start by extracting its extension. We will use the function file_ext from the package called tools. Sometimes, we do not want to load an entire package, but we want to access a single function. In those cases, we use the operator ::. Additionally, we will use paste0 to prefix the extension with a dot, so that we can use it later when we rename our files.\n\nextension &lt;- tools::file_ext(example_file)\nextension &lt;- paste0(\".\", extension)\nextension\n\nAs for the rest of the name, we will use the file_path_sans_ext() function that we used earlier.\n\nrest &lt;- tools::file_path_sans_ext(example_file)\nrest\n\n\n\nGet the subject id\nNow, the most important part is getting the subject name. If you look at what my rest variable returned, you can see that it consists of the last 4 characters, which are also the last set of characters after the last underscore. There are multiple ways to extract the subject id. I will show you both methods so that you can choose and adapt them for your own data. For the underscore version, we will use the function str_split(), and for the character counting, we will use str_sub().\n\nUnderscore approach\nstr_split() takes a string and splits it according to the separator you provide. In our case, the separator is the underscore. We are also using an additional argument called simplify to make the resulting elements more user-friendly. Our function now returns a small table with 1 row and 5 columns. To select the values in the 5th column, we use square brackets again, this time with a comma. When you apply this approach to your own data, remember that you may end up with fewer or more than 5 columns depending on your naming convention. Be sure to adjust the column number accordingly. It might also be the case that your subject id is not stored last or that your separators are not underscores but simple “-”. Modify the code according to your specific needs.\n\n# Using the underscore information\nsubj &lt;- str_split(rest, \"_\", simplify = TRUE)\nsubj\nsubj &lt;- subj[,5]\nsubj\n\nLastly, we have to modify the rest variable so that we do not include the subject id twice. I will use the same approach again. After obtaining the table, I will use the paste() function to concatenate the columns back together with the underscore separator. Adjust the number of columns used in this function and the separator according to your own data needs.\n\nnosubj &lt;- str_split(rest, \"_\", simplify = TRUE)\nnosubj &lt;- paste(nosubj[,1], nosubj[,2], nosubj[,3], nosubj[,4], sep = \"_\")\nnosubj\n\n\n\nCharacter approach\nstr_sub() allows you to extract a substring using indices. In my case, the subject id is the last four characters. To refer to characters from the end, you can use the minus symbol -. I specify -4 in the start argument, which means I want to extract the string starting from the fourth character counting back from the end.\n\nsubj &lt;- str_sub(rest, start = -4)\nsubj\n\nTo get the rest of the filename, I specify the starting point as 1 and the endpoint as -6. Using -5 would include the underscore as well.\n\nnosubj &lt;- str_sub(rest, start = 1, end = -6)\nnosubj\n\n\n\n\nPut the new name and the path together\nAt this point, we have everything we need: (i) the subject id prefix, (ii) the rest of our file name, and (iii) the extension. Now, we need to combine all of this together. We are going to use the paste0() function. Remember, this function is different from paste(). The main difference is that with paste0(), we cannot specify separators; we have to provide everything. This might seem like a disadvantage at first, but it is beneficial for non-pattern cases like this.\n\nnew_name &lt;- paste0(subj, \"_\", nosubj, extension)\nnew_name\n\nWe also need to create a new path to rename our file.\n\nnew_path &lt;- file.path(gold_dir, new_name)\nnew_path\n\n\n\nRename the file\nWe will once again use the file.rename() function. This time, we are only changing the file name and not the path, so the file will remain in its current location. We also need to obtain the full path of our example_file. We can achieve this easily using the file.path function again.\n\nexample_file_path &lt;- file.path(gold_dir, example_file)\nexample_file_path\n\n\nfile.rename(example_file_path, new_path)\n\nAfter running this, make sure the naming convention is as we want. Check your folder by searching for the trial. It should look something like subj_rest.wav or subj_rest.TextGrid. In my case, it is `, wheredltc` is my subject id or subj."

If you haven’t, here are the 3 lines to install MFA.\n\n\n\nConda Installation in Terminal\n\nconda activate base\nconda install -c conda-forge mamba\nmamba create -n aligner -c conda-forge montreal-forced-aligner\n\n\nThere are again two ways to do this. One way is to open your Terminal app or use the Terminal tab in the R console below. The other way, which I prefer more, is to execute commands using the R function system(). I will first go over the easier one, which is using the Terminal app or the Terminal tab in R. But the reason I prefer the system() function is that I can loop over multiple folders more easily that way, and I do not have to run my commands again and again.\n\nUsing Terminal\nThe first command we want to run is the conda environment code. Following the MFA documentation, I renamed my environment to aligner. So, I start by activating that environment.\n\nconda activate aligner\n\nAfter activating the environment, I need to download three models: (i) an acoustic model to recognize phonemes given previous and following acoustic features, (ii) a dictionary to access pretrained phone-word mappings, and (iii) a g2p model to generate sequences of phones based on orthography. For all of these models, we are going to use the english_us_arpa model. You can visit this website to explore various languages and models.\n\nmfa model download acoustic english_us_arpa\nmfa model download dictionary english_us_arpa\nmfa model download g2p english_us_arpa\n\nAfter downloading these models, we are going to validate our corpus. There are many customizable parameters for this step. You can check them here. I am going to use my favorite settings here. You can interpret the following command like this: Dear Montreal Forced Aligner (mfa), can you please analyze my files located in ~/Documents/MFA/mycorpus and validate them using the english_us_arpa acoustic model and english_us_arpa dictionary? Please also consider that I have multiple speakers, indicated by the first 4 characters (-s 4). It would be great to use multiprocessing (--use_mp) for faster execution. Lastly, please clean up previous and new temporary files (--clean --final_clean).\n\nmfa validate -s 4 --use_mp --clean --final_clean ~/Documents/MFA/mycorpus english_us_arpa english_us_arpa\n\nThis process will take some time. Afterward, you will have some out of vocabulary words found in your TextGrids. You can easily create new pronunciations for them and add them to your model.\nThe mfa g2p command can take many arguments; here I am using only three. First, the path to the text file that has out of vocabulary words. This file is automatically created in your folder where your files are located. The path may vary depending on your system and folder naming, but the name of the .txt file will be the same. In my case, it is ~/Documents/MFA/mycorpus/oovs_found_english_us_arpa.txt. The second argument is the name of the g2p model. As you may recall, we downloaded it earlier, and its name is english_us_arpa. Finally, the third argument is the path to a target .txt file to store new pronunciations. I would like to store them in the same place, so I am using the following path: ~/Documents/MFA/mycorpus/g2pped_oovs.txt.\n\nmfa g2p ~/Documents/MFA/mycorpus/oovs_found_english_us_arpa.txt english_us_arpa ~/Documents/MFA/mycorpus/g2pped_oovs.txt\n\nAfter creating the pronunciations, you can add them to your model with mfa model add_words. This command takes the name of the dictionary as an argument (english_us_arpa) and the output of the mfa g2p command, which was a .txt file storing pronunciations: ~/Documents/MFA/mycorpus/g2pped_oovs.txt.\n\nmfa model add_words english_us_arpa ~/Documents/MFA/mycorpus/g2pped_oovs.txt\n\nThe last step is the alignment process. It will align (mfa align) the words and the phones inside our TextGrids stored in ~/Documents/MFA/mycorpus using our previously downloaded dictionary (english_us_arpa) and model (english_us_arpa), and store the newly aligned TextGrids in a new folder called ~/Documents/MFA/output.\n\nmfa align ~/Documents/MFA/mycorpus english_us_arpa english_us_arpa ~/Documents/MFA/output\n\n\n\nUsing R\nWe can also accomplish all of this in R. One advantage of this approach is that it allows us to iterate over multiple subfolders more easily, which can be useful if we have more than 2000 files. We will use four components:\n\nsystem() function to execute terminal commands,\npaste() function to create multiline templates,\n%s string placeholder to create template codes,\nsprintf() function to format our templates.\n\n\nIntroduction to sprintf() and %s\nBefore going further with MFA codes, let me illustrate with an example. Suppose we have a list of folder names, and we want to create a .txt file in each of these folders. We can use the system() function to perform this action. Below, I define my folder_list, then create paths for my .txt files in each folder, such as ~/data1/mydocument.txt. Afterwards, I generate a list of commands to create these files using touch, which is a command-line tool for creating files. Finally, I execute these commands using the system() function.\n\nfolder_list &lt;- c(\"~/data1\", \"~/data2\", \"~/data3\")\n\n\ntxt_list &lt;- paste(folder_list, \"mydocument.txt\", sep=\"/\")\ntxt_list\ncommand_list &lt;- paste(\"touch\", txt_list, sep=\" \")\ncommand_list\n\nfor (command in command_list) {\n  system(command)\n}\n\nTechnically, we didn’t need to use a for loop; instead, we could have concatenated all these commands with ; and run a single system command. Bash can execute multiple commands in a single line when separated by ;.\n\nconcatenated_commands &lt;- paste(command_list[1], \n                               command_list[2], \n                               command_list[3], \n                               sep=\";\") \n\nsystem(concatenated_commands)\n\nWe could achieve the same without needing a folder list by utilizing the %s placeholder and the sprintf() function.\n\ncommand_template &lt;- \"touch %s/mydocument.txt\"\nconcatenated_commands &lt;- paste(sprintf(command_template, \"~/data1\"), \n                               sprintf(command_template, \"~/data2\"),\n                               sprintf(command_template, \"~/data3\"),\n                               sep=\";\")\n\nsystem(concatenated_commands)\n\nThis approach becomes particularly useful when dealing with multiple placeholders within the same command. For instance, the command template will replace the first %s with the first argument, such as ~/data1, and the second %s with the second argument, like mydoc1, when formatted using sprintf().\n\ncommand_template &lt;- \"touch %s/%s.txt\"\nconcatenated_commands &lt;- paste(sprintf(command_template, \"~/data1\", \"mydoc1\"), \n                               sprintf(command_template, \"~/data2\", \"mydoc2\"),\n                               sprintf(command_template, \"~/data3\", \"mydoc3\"),\n                               sep=\";\")\n\nsystem(concatenated_commands)\n\n\n\nRunning MFA in R\nNext, we’ll consolidate the previous code by concatenating it using paste() and separating commands with ;. If needed, we’ll incorporate placeholders. Each line will be assigned to a new variable, and then they’ll be combined into a single command string using paste(). Finally, we’ll execute the command string using system() with the argument intern = TRUE to capture the output into an R variable, which allows for later inspection.\n\nconda_start &lt;- \"conda activate aligner\"\nget_ac &lt;- \"mfa model download acoustic english_us_arpa\"\nget_dic &lt;- \"mfa model download dictionary english_us_arpa\"\nget_g2p &lt;- \"mfa model download g2p english_us_arpa\"\n\nmfa_init &lt;- paste(conda_start, get_ac, get_dic, get_g2p, sep = \";\")\n\nmfa_init_output &lt;- system(mfa_init, intern = TRUE)\n\nAfter initializing the model, the next step involves validation. Again, I’ll use the same approach and concatenate the commands together. However, sometimes we may have too many files and need to use subfolders. To accommodate this, I’ll use %s placeholders. The validation command has one placeholder for different subfolders. Similarly, our pronunciation creation for g2p has two placeholders, though they’ll be filled with the same value. Lastly, the add_words command will use a single placeholder. Fortunately, all these folders are the same, so we can reuse the same variable repeatedly.\n\nconda_start &lt;- \"conda activate aligner\"\n\nvalidate &lt;- \"mfa validate -s 4 --use_mp --clean --final_clean ~/Documents/MFA/%s english_us_arpa english_us_arpa\"\ng2p_words &lt;- \"mfa g2p ~/Documents/MFA/%s/oovs_found_english_us_arpa.txt english_us_arpa ~/Documents/MFA/%s/g2pped_oovs.txt\"\nadd_words &lt;- \"mfa model add_words english_us_arpa ~/Documents/MFA/%s/g2pped_oovs.txt\"\n\nmfa_val &lt;- paste(conda_start, validate, g2p_words, add_words, sep = \";\")\n\nSince this step takes longer and there’s more room for errors, I want to save all my outputs in a list. First, I need to identify which folders exist in my MFA directory. Because my divide_and_move function prefixes every subfolder with s, I’ll use ^s to filter for relevant folders.\n\noutput_val &lt;- list()\n\n# Define the base path where folders are located\nbase_path &lt;- \"~/Documents/MFA\"\nfolders &lt;- list.dirs(base_path, recursive = FALSE, full.names = FALSE)\nfolders &lt;- folders[str_detect(folders, \"^s\")]\n\nfolders\n\nNow, we can iterate over this list of folders using a for loop. First, we create a temporary script using sprintf() with four placeholders. Next, we execute the current script and save the output in a temp_output variable. Later, we assign this output to specific output_name variables for each folder using paste0() and assign() functions.\n\nfor (f in folders) {\n  cur_mfa_val &lt;- sprintf(mfa_val, f, f, f, f)\n  \n  temp_output &lt;- system(cur_mfa_val, intern = TRUE)\n  \n  output_name &lt;- paste0(\"output_val_\", f)\n  \n  assign(output_name, temp_output, envir = .GlobalEnv)\n}\n\nNow you can check the outputs by calling specific variables like output_val_s1 or output_val_s2. After this step, the only task remaining is to run the aligner. We will create a template again, iterate over folders, and assign outputs to their respective names for verification. Meanwhile, the bash code will execute in the background. This time, our placeholders will refer to different inputs and an output folder. Fortunately, we can use the same output folder for every subfolder, so instead of using two placeholders, we’ll use a single %s placeholder.\n\nconda_start &lt;- \"conda activate aligner\"\n\nalign &lt;- \"mfa align ~/Documents/MFA/%s english_us_arpa english_us_arpa ~/Documents/MFA/output\"\n\nmfa_align &lt;- paste(conda_start, align, sep = \";\")\n\nfor (f in folders) {\n  cur_mfa_align &lt;- sprintf(mfa_align, f)\n  temp_output &lt;- system(cur_mfa_align, intern=TRUE)\n  output_name &lt;- paste0(\"output_align_\", f)\n  assign(output_name, temp_output, envir = .GlobalEnv)\n}\n\nThis for loop completes the MFA alignment. There is one final task remaining: creating a dataframe for further data analysis."

Additionally, I am not interested in retaining the file extension in the file identifier.

    "text": "For-loop\nNow, we need to apply this process to all files in our output directory. To simplify this, I’ll start by creating a function for processing each file individually and then apply it to all files. The function takes a file name and its directory as inputs and returns a dataframe. Before creating each dataframe, it prints “Reading the file.” to indicate progress.\n\nprocess_textgrid &lt;- function(file, directory) {\n  cat(\"Reading\", file, \"\\n\")\n  file_path &lt;- file.path(directory, file)\n  df &lt;- readtextgrid::read_textgrid(path = file_path) |&gt;\n    filter(tier_name == \"words\" & text != \"\") |&gt;\n    select(file, xmin, xmax, text, annotation_num) |&gt;\n    mutate(file = str_remove(file, \"\\\\.TextGrid$\"),\n           response = paste(text, collapse = \" \"))\n  \n  df &lt;- df |&gt;\n    separate_wider_delim(file, \"_\", names = c(\"subj\", \"exp\", \"headVerb\", \"NumNum\", \"sem_type\"), cols_remove = F) |&gt;\n    separate_wider_regex(headVerb, c(head = \".*\", \"U\", verb_type = \".*\")) |&gt;\n    mutate(verb_type = paste0(\"U\", verb_type)) |&gt;\n    separate_wider_position(NumNum, c(head_num = 2, dist_num = 2))\n  \n  return(df)\n}\n\nThis is essentially the same process as before, but encapsulated within a function for easier application. Here’s an example of how I’m redefining my directory and file list:\n\n# Define the directory and list files\ntg_dir &lt;- \"~/Documents/MFA/output\"\nfile_list &lt;- list.files(path = tg_dir, pattern = \"\\\\.TextGrid$\")\nexample_file &lt;- file_list[1]\nprocess_textgrid(example_file, tg_dir)\n\nYour version will look like this.\n\nprocess_textgrid &lt;- function(file, directory) {\n  cat(\"Reading\", file, \"\\n\")\n  file_path &lt;- file.path(directory, file)\n  df &lt;- readtextgrid::read_textgrid(path = file_path) |&gt;\n    filter(tier_name == \"words\" & text != \"\") |&gt;\n    select(file, xmin, xmax, text, annotation_num) |&gt;\n    mutate(file = str_remove(file, \"\\\\.TextGrid$\"),\n           response = paste(text, collapse = \" \"))\n  \n  df &lt;- df |&gt;\n    separate_wider_delim(file, \"_\", names = c(\"subj\", \"head\", \"condition\"), cols_remove = F) \n  \n  return(df)\n}\n\n\n# Define the directory and list files\ntg_dir &lt;- \"~/Documents/MFA/output\"\nfile_list &lt;- list.files(path = tg_dir, pattern = \"\\\\.TextGrid$\")\nexample_file &lt;- file_list[1]\nprocess_textgrid(example_file, tg_dir)\n\nNow, we need to integrate this function into our for-loop. Instead of using a single file like file_list[1], we will apply it to an entire directory. Unlike previous for loops, we will use the map function from the purrr package. It is faster and easier to use in cases like this. map() will return all of our dataframes embedded in a list. After using map(), we need to combine all these smaller dataframes into a larger one using bind_rows.\n\n# Define the directory and list files\ntg_dir &lt;- \"~/Documents/MFA/output\"\nfile_list &lt;- list.files(path = tg_dir, pattern = \"\\\\.TextGrid$\")\n# Run our function, I am using mine, you should use your own.\nprocess_textgrid &lt;- function(file, directory) {\n  cat(\"Reading\", file, \"\\n\")\n  file_path &lt;- file.path(directory, file)\n  df &lt;- readtextgrid::read_textgrid(path = file_path) |&gt;\n    filter(tier_name == \"words\" & text != \"\") |&gt;\n    select(file, xmin, xmax, text, annotation_num) |&gt;\n    mutate(file = str_remove(file, \"\\\\.TextGrid$\"),\n           response = paste(text, collapse = \" \"))\n  \n  df &lt;- df |&gt;\n    separate_wider_delim(file, \"_\", names = c(\"subj\", \"exp\", \"headVerb\", \"NumNum\", \"sem_type\"), cols_remove = F) |&gt;\n    separate_wider_regex(headVerb, c(head = \".*\", \"U\", verb_type = \".*\")) |&gt;\n    mutate(verb_type = paste0(\"U\", verb_type)) |&gt;\n    separate_wider_position(NumNum, c(head_num = 2, dist_num = 2))\n  \n  return(df)\n}\n\ndfs &lt;- map(file_list, process_textgrid, directory = tg_dir)\n\nfinal_df &lt;- bind_rows(dfs)\n\nThis completes our MFA Aligning work. We have successfully completed every task on our list, aligned our data, and created a dataframe for analysis. You can check the structure of our final dataframe, the number of rows, and the count of unique trials.\n\nstr(final_df)\n\nnrow(final_df)\n\nlength(unique(final_df$file))"

    "section": "",
    "text": "This post is part of a series I’m calling Misunderstandings. The idea is simple: I pick up on talks, papers, or arguments that I admire but also don’t quite buy in the way they’re framed. Sometimes I pose counterexamples, sometimes I just get tangled in the details. The label isn’t meant as dismissive—usually the “misunderstanding” is mine—but I find that pushing on these points is a good way to clarify what’s at stake.\nKate Mooney’s recent talk at UMass, Segmental phonology, gestural phonetics: Explaining asymmetries between phonological and phonetic operations, was about something deceptively simple: are phonological processes uniform?\nThe traditional view has been “yes.” If an alternation applies freely, that’s phonology. If it’s tied to a particular morpheme, that’s phonology too, just gated by a diacritic, indexed constraint, or cyclic ranking. The assumption is that the underlying machinery is the same; what differs is timing and scope.\nKate pushed back. She focused on vowel harmony versus vowel co-articulation. Zsiga had already argued these belong to different representational domains—rules vs gestures—but Kate sharpened the contrast. Vowel harmony: categorical, typologically robust, governed by rules. Vowel coarticulation: gradient, gestural blending, and crucially never morphologically restricted. That asymmetry, she argued, is real. If you try to collapse the two into one “uniform phonology,” you erase those typological gaps.\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tibble)\n\ngrid &lt;- tibble(\n  x = factor(c(\"Categorical\",\"Categorical\",\"Gradient\",\"Gradient\"),\n             levels = c(\"Categorical\",\"Gradient\")),\n  y = factor(c(\"Restricted\",\"Unrestricted\",\"Restricted\",\"Unrestricted\"),\n             levels = c(\"Restricted\",\"Unrestricted\")),\n  box = c(\"Phonology\", \"—\", \"Empty (predicted)\", \"Phonetics\"),\n  note = c(\"e.g., vowel harmony,\\nmorph. alternations\",\n           \"\",\n           \"“No coarticulation\\nrestricted by morphology”\",\n           \"e.g., coarticulation\")\n)\n\n# numeric positions for highlighting the lower-left tile cleanly\ngrid_num &lt;- grid %&gt;%\n  mutate(xn = as.numeric(x), yn = as.numeric(y))\n\ngg &lt;- ggplot(grid, aes(x, y)) +\n  # tiles and borders\n  geom_tile(fill = \"grey95\", color = \"grey40\", linewidth = 0.6) +\n  # red outline around Gradient + Restricted (predicted empty)\n  geom_rect(\n    data = filter(grid_num, x == \"Gradient\", y == \"Restricted\"),\n    aes(xmin = xn - 0.5, xmax = xn + 0.5, ymin = yn - 0.5, ymax = yn + 0.5),\n    inherit.aes = FALSE, fill = NA, color = \"#bb0000\", linewidth = 1\n  ) +\n  # main labels\n  geom_text(aes(label = box), fontface = \"bold\", vjust = -0.2, size = 4) +\n  # notes beneath each label\n  geom_text(aes(label = note), vjust = 1.2, lineheight = 1.0, size = 3.2) +\n  # put Restricted on top row for readability\n  scale_y_discrete(limits = rev(levels(grid$y))) +\n  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL) +\n  coord_fixed() +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 12) +\n  theme(\n    panel.grid = element_blank(),\n    axis.text = element_text(face = \"bold\")\n  )\n\ngg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: A schematic 2×2 for Kate’s asymmetry. The gradient+restricted quadrant is predicted empty.\nIt’s a nice move because it comes with clear predictions. You shouldn’t get consonant copy or epenthesis as general phonotactic repairs, only as morphologically restricted alternations. You shouldn’t get morphologically restricted coarticulation. The grid is crisp: categorical + restricted = phonology, gradient + free = phonetics.\nI should also say I’m not hostile to this move. In fact, I like the idea that phonology and phonetics are not a uniform system. Substance-free phonology has long made a similar claim: phonology is its own representational domain, not reducible to phonetic substance. I’ve always found that perspective appealing, and Kate’s framework fits that general spirit even though she keeps an arm’s-length stance toward committing to any particular theory.\nBut I’m suspicious of two-level partitions in general. I feel like in cognitive sciences, whenever there is a hard to explain data, first instinct of many people is to propose a two-level model. Automatic vs controlled processing, System 1 vs System 2 reasoning, parsing vs grammar. Sometimes, this two-level model is needed, especially when it is used to isolate a problem. For example, in the case of I-language idea, it was a powerful tool to carve a theoretical space just to discuss grammar. However, as theorization accumulated, this distinction sometimes used as a pile of “I-actually-dont-have-any-idea-so-it-might-be-processing”.\nThis pattern is everywhere in cognitive science, and all of these frameworks—including what Kate’s suggesting—share the same basic architecture: one process is fast, automatic, and associative; the other is slow, deliberate, and rule-based. The hope is that human behavior can be explained by sorting phenomena into the right bin. And of course, if you set out to show that sometimes people behave automatically and make mistakes; sometimes they behave deliberately and do not make mistakes, you’ll find confirmation all over the place.\nBut as Gawronski, Sherman & Trope (2014) point out, dual-process theories only make progress if they meet a demanding set of conditions: they must specify what the two systems actually are (their operating principles), not just when they operate; they must define the boundaries of each system clearly; and they must generate empirical predictions that could, in principle, be falsified. Otherwise, they collapse into post-hoc labeling—System 1 when it’s effortless, System 2 when it’s not. While dual-process frameworks can be falsifiable in principle, they are often practically unfalsifiable because the internal ‘systems’ aren’t anchored to observable input–output relations. Almost any finding can be retrofitted: if an effect looks automatic, it’s assigned to System 1; if it’s resource-dependent, to System 2.\nThat’s my main worry here. Dual-process models are a tempting last resort. They look tidy, but they often function as theories that can’t really lose—precisely the kind that Popper warned us about. John von Neumann put it bluntly: “With four parameters I can fit an elephant, and with five I can make him wiggle his trunk.” And if you add one more, you can even make him wink. There’s even an R implementation—the winking pink elephant—that literally draws and animates an elephant with just a handful of parameters. It’s cute, but it’s also the point: if your model is that flexible, fitting isn’t the same thing as explaining. (The original code is base R/MASS heavy, but you can rewrite it cleanly with ggplot2 and dplyr.)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# --- parameters (as in your code) ---\nparam  &lt;- c(50-30i, 18+8i, 12-10i, -14-60i, 1+20i)\nparar  &lt;- param * exp(1i*pi/2)                # rotate 90°\ntv     &lt;- seq(0, 2*pi, length.out = 1000)\n\n# Vectorized Fourier helper (same math as your recursive version)\nfourier_vec &lt;- function(tt, cc) {\n  n &lt;- seq_along(cc)\n  cosmat &lt;- cos(outer(tt, n, `*`))\n  sinmat &lt;- sin(outer(tt, n, `*`))\n  as.vector(cosmat %*% Re(cc) + sinmat %*% Im(cc))\n}\n\n# Build one frame\nbuild_curve &lt;- function(i) {\n  Cx &lt;- complex(length(param))\n  Cy &lt;- complex(length(param))\n  Cx[1] &lt;- parar[1] + Im(param[1])\n  Cx[2] &lt;- parar[2] + Im(param[2])\n  Cx[3] &lt;- Re(param[3])\n  Cx[4] &lt;- Re(param[5]) - (i-1)   # trunk wiggle\n  Cx[5] &lt;- Re(param[4])\n\n  Cy[1] &lt;- param[1] - Re(param[1]) + Im(param[4])\n  Cy[2] &lt;- param[2] - Re(param[2])\n  Cy[3] &lt;- param[3] - Re(param[3])\n  # Cy[4:5] remain 0+0i (as in your code)\n\n  x &lt;- fourier_vec(tv, Cx)\n  y &lt;- fourier_vec(tv, Cy)\n\n  # Base plot used: plot(y, -x, ...)\n  data.frame(\n    X = y,\n    Y = -x,\n    frame = factor(i, levels = 1:2, labels = c(\"4 params\",\"5 params\"))\n  )\n}\n\ncurves &lt;- rbind(build_curve(1), build_curve(2))\n\n# Eye: pch=20 (filled) on frame 1, pch=126 (\"~\") on frame 2\neyes &lt;- data.frame(\n  X = rep(Im(param[5]), 2),\n  Y = rep(Im(param[5]), 2),\n  frame = factor(c(\"4 params\",\"5 params\"), levels = c(\"4 params\",\"5 params\")),\n  shape = c(20, 126)\n)\n\np &lt;- ggplot(curves, aes(X, Y)) +\n  # thick red under-stroke\n  geom_path(aes(group = frame), size = 2.5, color = \"red\") +\n  # thinner pink over-stroke\n  geom_path(aes(group = frame), size = 1, color = \"pink\") +\n  # eye (exact pch replication)\n  geom_point(data = eyes, aes(shape = shape), size = 3, color = \"black\") +\n  scale_shape_identity() +\n  coord_fixed() +\n  facet_wrap(~ frame, nrow = 1) +\n  labs(x = \"x\", y = \"y\", title = \"Neumann's Elephant (ggplot)\") +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 13)\n\n\np_crop &lt;- p\np_crop$layers &lt;- Filter(function(l) !inherits(l$geom, \"GeomPoint\"), p$layers)\np_crop &lt;- p_crop %+% subset(curves, frame == \"4 params\") + coord_fixed() \n\nggsave(\"fourier_elephant.png\", plot = p_crop, width = 8, height = 4, dpi = 300)\n\np \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: “With four parameters I can fit an elephant.” The outline is generated by a short Fourier series using complex coefficients.\nThat’s where Turkish comes in."

    "text": "The Turkish case\nAs it is almost a common knowledge, Turkish exhibit multiple vowel harmonies. Harmonization spread from left to right. The easier one is the backness/frontness harmony. For example, the plural morpheme in Turkish can surface as either -lar or -ler, depending on the last vowel in the word that they are attaching. It is argued that plural morpheme is underspecified in its backness characteristics. And, whatever the value of the previous vowel, it spread into the plural morpheme.\n\n[yzym] + /-lAr/ -&gt; [yzymler]\n[adam] + /-lAr/ -&gt; [adamlar]\n\nAnother present harmony is Backness and Roundness Harmony. For example, the accusative case can surface as -ɨ, -i, -u, -y in Turkish. Again, the way that it is going to surface is completely dependent on the previous vowel. In this case, the accusative case is underspecified for its roundness and backness, but not underspecified for its height, -I.\n\n[adam] + /-I/ -&gt; [adamɨ]\n[herif] + /-I/ -&gt; [herifi]\n[odun] + /-I/ -&gt; [odunu]\n[yzym] + /-I/ -&gt; [yzymy]\n\nTurkish does not have any other widely accepted vowel harmony apart from these two. This means that Turkish normally doesn’t have free-standing rounding harmony. Moreover, Turkish vowel harmony is strictly word-internal and left-to-right. Backwards harmony is virtually absent. Between-word harmony is nonexistent.\nHowever, there is an interesting case in which all of these properties are overhauled. Turkish exhibit optional vowel characteristic change in a very specific environment. In fast production of complex noun phrases (an NP and a modifier), speakers often round the initial vowel of the second NP (NP2) if:\n\nThe last vowel of NP1 is [+round].\n\nThe first vowel of NP2 is [+high, –round].\n\nThe second vowel of NP2 is [+round].\n\nNP1 ends in a single consonant (clusters tend to block it).\n\n\nExamples (NP1 modifiers in italics):\n\nbir ikon (one icon) → [bir ikon] but on ikon (ten icons) → [on ykon]\niki milyon (two millions) → [iki miljon] but dokuz milyon (nine millions) → [dokuz mylyon]\n\ngüzel vizyon (beautiful vision) → [gyzel vizyon] but hoş vizyon (nice vision) → [hoʃ vyzyon]\nbazı sigorta (some insurance) → [bazɨ sigorta] but tüm sigorta (whole insurance) → [tym sygorta]\ntek biyoloji (single biology) → [tek bijoloʒi] but vücut biyoloji (body biology) → [vyʒut byjoloʒi]\n\nNot everything goes through:\n\nüç nilüfer (three lilies) → [ytʃ nilüfer] (no rounding)\n\ntüm limon (whole lemon) → [tym limon] (no rounding)\n\nküçük işgücü (small workforce) → [küçük işgücü] (blocked by CC cluster)\n\n\nLoanwords are especially revealing. Epenthetic vowels often participate: hipodrom, sigorta, diskotek. Compounds resist, especially when the boundary is vowel–vowel. Some high-frequency words seem entrenched with disharmony, like dinazor (originally dinozor). There are also asymmetries with labials: sometimes a labial consonant plus a preceding rounded vowel creates the right environment, but not always (nilüfer resists)."

    "text": "Why it bugs me\nAt first glance, this seems like a good evidence for Kate’s argument.\n\nIt’s optional: It does not necessarily go through, actually you will hear people do not make the rounding bunch of the times.\nIt’s gradient: I do not feel like the vowel quality of the rounded one is similar to other round vowels.\nIt seems to apply semi-automatically in fast speech.\n\nHowever, Kate’s argument relies on the non-collapsibility of the quadrant. An event that looks like this should be co-articulation, and should happen irregardless of morphological or syntactic environment. However, that is not the case for this phenomenon. This specific bidirectional vowel harmony, or stuck vowel, only occurs within the syntactically complex DPs. It does not occur within the same word when the same configuration exist. On the contrary, within the same root, there is an additional push for creating disharmony [see Clements and Sezer].\nIn phrases that is not dominated by the same syntactic node, this rounding harmony does not occur. For example, in a sentence like (1), one would expect “ikon” to be pronounced as [ykon] due to the presence of the adverb dün [dyn] prior to it, however, that is not the case. The same resistance is preserved even if we do not have this string in a place close to the topic area, the left-most phrases in Turkish sentences. The same resistance is still preserved if we place these two elements post-verbally, where they are produced in the same breadth, without a possible prosodic break.\n\nDün ikon aldım `I bought an icon yesterday’\nBen Ahmetlerin dükkanından dün ikon aldım. `I bought an icon yesterday from Ahmets’ store’\nBen Ahmetlerin dükkanından aldım dün ikon. `I bought an icon yesterday from Ahmets’ store’\n\nThis is exactly the quadrant that Kate’s asymmetry says should be empty: co-articulation is supposed to be gradient and unrestricted, phonology is supposed to be categorical and morphological. Turkish gives you a phenomenon that’s both gradient but restricted.\nMy worry is that the two-level carve—categorical vs gradient, phonology vs phonetics—is just too strong. If phonology is supposed to be categorical and morphologically restricted, and phonetics gradient and unrestricted, what do we do with Turkish? Calling it “just coarticulation” ignores the morphological conditioning. Calling it “phonology” ignores the gradient, variable character.\nMaybe I’m misunderstanding Kate’s point—her claim is typological, and she might be perfectly happy calling Turkish an outlier. But it makes me uneasy. Two-level models are good at drawing clean lines, and that’s why they’re attractive. But reality doesn’t always honor the bins we set up for it. One possibility is that coarticulation might be systematically governed prosodical structure. As of now, I categorize this in terms of nouns and their modifiers. It is possible that this is generalized to other heads and their modifiers. Then the question would be the following: is this rounding-harmony conditioned by prosodical structure that is a by-product of “head-modifier” relation or is it conditioned by syntactic locality?"

    "text": "Summary:\n\nData Analysis Key Findings\n\nData Preparation: The data was successfully prepared for PyMC3 modeling by extracting ‘CLIP_Similarity’, ‘Subject_Salience’, ‘VLM_Score’, and ‘VerbType’. ‘VerbType’ was numerically encoded (Unergative: 0, Unaccusative: 1), and continuous variables were scaled using MinMaxScaler.\nCLIP Similarity Model:\n\nThe beta parameter, representing the effect of VerbType on CLIP_Similarity, had a mean of -0.164.\nThe 94% Highest Posterior Density (HPD) interval for beta was [-0.370, 0.022].\nThe negative mean suggests lower CLIP similarity for Unaccusative scenes compared to Unergative scenes, but the HPD interval crossing zero indicates this difference is not statistically significant.\n\nSubject Salience Model:\n\nThe beta parameter for the effect of VerbType on Subject_Salience had a mean of -0.100.\nIts 94% HPD interval was [-0.311, 0.130].\nA negative mean suggests lower subject salience for Unaccusative scenes, but the HPD interval crossing zero indicates this difference is not statistically significant.\n\nVLM Score Model:\n\nThe beta parameter for the effect of VerbType on the latent propensity for VLM_Score had a mean of -0.830.\nIts 94% HPD interval was [-1.854, 0.167].\nThe negative mean suggests that Unaccusative scenes are associated with a lower latent propensity for higher VLM scores, but the HPD interval crossing zero indicates this difference is not statistically significant.\n\nOverall Comparison: For all three metrics (CLIP Similarity, Subject Salience, and VLM Score), the Bayesian regression models suggest a general tendency for unaccusative verbs to be associated with lower scores compared to unergative verbs (indicated by negative beta means). However, these observed differences are not statistically significant at the 94% HPD level for any of the models, as their respective credible intervals for the beta parameter all include zero.\n\n\n\nInsights or Next Steps\n\nInvestigate Data Variability: Although the models indicate a directional trend (unaccusative scenes tending towards lower scores), the lack of statistical significance suggests high variability within the data or insufficient sample size to detect a clear difference. Further data collection or exploration of other covariates might be beneficial.\nExplore Alternative Model Specifications: Consider alternative model structures or priors, or even hierarchical models if there are grouping factors in the data, to see if a more nuanced understanding of the VerbType effect can be achieved."

CLIP Similarity Model (Linear Regression):\n\nPosterior Mean of Intercept (alpha): 0.000 (indicating that when VerbType is centered, the average CLIP_Similarity is near zero).\nPosterior Mean of VerbType Effect (beta): -2.254\n\nThis negative mean suggests that Unaccusative scenes (encoded as 0.5) are associated with a lower CLIP Similarity compared to Unergative scenes (encoded as -0.5).\n\nProbability (beta &lt; 0): 0.936\n\nThere is a 93.6% probability that the effect of ‘VerbType’ on ‘CLIP_Similarity’ is negative, meaning unaccusative scenes tend to have lower CLIP similarity scores.\n\nProbability (beta &gt; 0): 0.064\n94% HPD for beta: [-5.265, 0.348]\n\nThe 94% Highest Posterior Density interval for beta includes zero, suggesting that while there’s a strong tendency for a negative effect, it’s not statistically significant at this credible interval level.\n\n\n\n\n2. Subject Salience Model (Linear Regression):\n\nPosterior Mean of Intercept (alpha): 0.026\nPosterior Mean of VerbType Effect (beta): -1.502\n\nThis indicates that Unaccusative scenes tend to have lower Subject Salience scores compared to Unergative scenes.\n\nProbability (beta &lt; 0): 0.818\n\nThere is an 81.8% probability that the effect of ‘VerbType’ on ‘Subject_Salience’ is negative.\n\nProbability (beta &gt; 0): 0.182\n94% HPD for beta: [-4.741, 1.698]\n\nThe 94% HPD interval for beta includes zero, indicating that the observed negative effect is not statistically significant.\n\n\n\n\n3. VLM Score Model (Ordered Logistic Regression):\n\nPosterior Mean of Intercept (alpha): 4.860 (representing the latent propensity when VerbType is centered).\nPosterior Mean of VerbType Effect (beta): -1.822\n\nThis negative mean implies that Unaccusative scenes are associated with a lower latent propensity for higher VLM scores compared to Unergative scenes.\n\nProbability (beta &lt; 0): 0.987\n\nThere is a high probability (98.7%) that the effect of ‘VerbType’ on the latent propensity for ‘VLM_Score’ is negative, strongly suggesting that unaccusative scenes are rated lower by the VLM.\n\nProbability (beta &gt; 0): 0.013\n94% HPD for beta: [-3.366, -0.198]\n\nThe 94% HPD interval for beta does not include zero, which indicates that the negative effect of ‘VerbType’ on ‘VLM_Score’ is statistically significant. Unaccusative scenes are significantly associated with lower VLM ratings.\n\n\n\n\n\nOverall Conclusion:\nAcross all three models, there is a consistent directional trend: Unaccusative scenes tend to be associated with lower scores in CLIP Similarity, Subject Salience, and VLM Score. While this trend is not statistically significant for CLIP Similarity and Subject Salience at the 94% HPD level (their credible intervals for beta include zero), the VLM Score model shows a statistically significant negative effect of Unaccusative verb types, with the 94% HPD interval entirely below zero. This suggests that the Qwen-VL-Chat model finds unaccusative scenes perceptually harder to interpret or verify against their descriptions than unergative scenes, aligning with the initial hypothesis that unaccusative scenes might be perceptually more challenging."

    "section": "",
    "text": "During my PhD, I’ve become fairly obsessed with production studies. I find them extremely interesting, especially the way they combine what we know from theoretical linguistics with creative experimental methods. Not to mention that the theoretical framing of production work is quite poor and the main theories used need a major overhaul. One of the most interesting papers in this area is Shota Momma’s work on advanced verb planning. Similar work was also done in German and Basque by Sebastian Sauppe’s group.\nLet me set the scene. He and his colleagues ran multiple picture description experiments where participants saw images like: - “The octopus below the spoon is swimming” (unergative) - “The octopus below the spoon is boiling” (unaccusative)\nIf you’re not a syntax nerd, here’s the ultra-compressed version: verbs like “swim” and “bark” (unergatives) are different from verbs like “sink” and “melt” (unaccusatives), even though they both describe single-argument events. The difference has to do with argument structure—where the subject comes from in the underlying syntax. It has been argued that the subjects of unaccusatives are actually ‘deep objects’ for lack of a better term, and they structurally start in the same position as any other object.\nThey showed that these two verb types behave differently in production experiments. Speakers plan them differently. They tested this by showing related or unrelated words superimposed on the pictures. They found that when the verbs were related, participants slowed down before they started speaking—but only with unaccusatives. His theoretical claim was that unaccusative verbs are planned earlier in the sentence production process—possibly right at the beginning, along with the subject.\n\n\n\nHere’s the thing. Another thing that made me very excited about the production endeavor is that there are probably so many possible confounds that require checking. And I love this song and dance in psycholinguistics, where I can stress-test findings and see how stable they are. It’s especially important when you find an unexpected result—like participants taking longer to start speaking when they won’t say the verb for at least 3 more seconds—my first instinct, and I hope yours, is to wonder: “Is this real, or is something else going on?”\nThis post is built on a very specific worry: What if unaccusative scenes themselves, and not the syntax of them, created the results? One interesting finding in Shota Momma’s papers was that unergative planning was seemingly invisible. He has shown that there are reasons to believe that it happens while saying the second NP. But quantitatively, the signature of unergative planning seems to be more dissolved throughout the sentence, while the unaccusative planning is strikingly clear.\nThis creates the following question: is it possible that participants, simply because the picture was more difficult to understand or the subject was more involved in the action, spent more time initially to either understand the event or to extract the subject from the event, and during this time a deterministic analysis of the written word kicked in and slowed them down when it was related? Since the unergative subjects are more easily dissociable from the event, since nothing is happening to them in those pictures, it takes less time, and since it’s less of a resource-heavy process, no additional process interferes with it. This has several predictions. First, in follow-up experiments where the unergative pictures are hard to ‘retrieve’ from the scene, one should see similar onset effects. Second, if there is some sort of picture-difficulty metric, the advance planning should align with that metric item-wise.\nThe second prediction is going to be the basis of this blog post, where we will find a way to quantify the picture difficulty.\n\n\n\nI assume the following ‘two-way’ distinction with respect to lexical verbs. However, one needs to admit that unaccusativity is not stable all the time. Many such unaccusative verbs can be used as unergatives given some adverbial modification or different contexts. This would create some minor infelicity in English, but that is not the case for many languages. For example, Laz can make any verb ‘agentive’ with a small prefix. Imagine a Laz-type English where you have “I cried” vs. “I do-cried,” where the second one means that you made yourself cry or you deliberately cried. Or a better example might be: imagine if English “jump” were decomposable into a prefix “do-” and “fall.” So, for now I only assume that these properties are lexical properties of the verb, but one needs to admit that these are event-related ones.\n\nUnergative actions (swimming, barking, running): The action is performed by the agent. You can see the octopus swimming—the action is somewhat separable from what happens to the entity.\nUnaccusative actions (boiling, melting, sinking): Something is happening to the entity. The octopus isn’t “doing” boiling—it’s undergoing a change of state. The action and the entity are less separable.\n\nAnother assumption I make is about CLIP/VLM. The input that CLIP takes is a written sentence and a picture. I am fully aware that the way CLIP assesses pictures is nowhere near how humans do.1 I am also aware that in human speech, the scenes are what is encoded and the speech is the decoding. CLIP works differently. CLIP is a two-encoder model. Given two inputs of a picture and a text, it creates two separate vectors and checks how similar those vectors are. Thus, it does not give us anything about human cognition. But it gives us a way to quantify relevant metrics. Below what I assume to be the models of human speech production based on Levelt’s work and CLIP’s architecture.\nLevelt’s Speech Production Model:\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart TD\n    A[Conceptualizer] --&gt; |Preverbal Message| B[Formulator]\n    B --&gt; |Grammatical Encoding| C[Mental Lexicon&lt;br/&gt;Lemmas]\n    C --&gt; B\n    B --&gt; |Phonological Encoding| D[Mental Lexicon&lt;br/&gt;Forms]\n    D --&gt; B\n    B --&gt; |Phonetic Plan| E[Articulator]\n    E --&gt; |Overt Speech| F[OUTPUT]\n    E -.-&gt; |Self-Monitoring| G[Speech Comprehension&lt;br/&gt;System]\n    G -.-&gt; A\n\n    style A fill:#e1f5dd\n    style B fill:#d4e9f7\n    style C fill:#fff3cd\n    style D fill:#fff3cd\n    style E fill:#ffd4e5\n    style F fill:#f8d7da\n    style G fill:#e8e8e8\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCLIP Architecture:\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart TD\n    A[Picture] --&gt; B[Image Encoder]\n    C[Text] --&gt; D[Text Encoder]\n    B --&gt; E[Image Embedding]\n    D --&gt; F[Text Embedding]\n    E --&gt; G[Similarity Score]\n    F --&gt; G\n\n    style A fill:#e1f5dd\n    style C fill:#e1f5dd\n    style B fill:#d4e9f7\n    style D fill:#d4e9f7\n    style E fill:#fff3cd\n    style F fill:#fff3cd\n    style G fill:#f8d7da\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMultimodal LLMs:\nMore recently, multimodal large language models have emerged that work quite differently from CLIP. Instead of creating separate embeddings and comparing them, these models integrate visual and textual information into a unified representation and can generate natural language descriptions or answers about images.\nI have to say, writing their code is also a bit funny. You basically have to build a pipeline where you create a ‘chat template’ and ask them to give you an output. I am not sure that is how you are supposed to use them, but it works.2\nModels like Qwen3-Omni take both images and text as input, process them through vision encoders and language models together, and generate coherent text outputs. Unlike CLIP’s similarity metric, multimodal LLMs can provide richer, more nuanced interpretations of visual scenes and answer complex questions about them. We will use both of them and compare here.\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart TD\n    A[Picture] --&gt; B[Vision Encoder]\n    C[Text Prompt] --&gt; D[Tokenizer]\n    B --&gt; E[Visual Tokens]\n    D --&gt; F[Text Tokens]\n    E --&gt; G[Unified LLM]\n    F --&gt; G\n    G --&gt; H[Generated Text Output]\n\n    style A fill:#e1f5dd\n    style C fill:#e1f5dd\n    style B fill:#d4e9f7\n    style D fill:#d4e9f7\n    style E fill:#fff3cd\n    style F fill:#fff3cd\n    style G fill:#ffd4e5\n    style H fill:#f8d7da\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLastly, these experiments were conducted as a extended-PWI experiment, where participants were provided with a picture with a superimposed text on it. Neither the pictures, nor the tasks I improvise here does not have any relation to picture word interference task.

    "title": "When Pictures Don’t Match Words: Using CLIP to Validate Experimental Stimuli",
    "section": "",
    "text": "During my PhD, I’ve become fairly obsessed with production studies. I find them extremely interesting, especially the way they combine what we know from theoretical linguistics with creative experimental methods. Not to mention that the theoretical framing of production work is quite poor and the main theories used need a major overhaul. One of the most interesting papers in this area is Shota Momma’s work on advanced verb planning. Similar work was also done in German and Basque by Sebastian Sauppe’s group.\nLet me set the scene. He and his colleagues ran multiple picture description experiments where participants saw images like: - “The octopus below the spoon is swimming” (unergative) - “The octopus below the spoon is boiling” (unaccusative)\nIf you’re not a syntax nerd, here’s the ultra-compressed version: verbs like “swim” and “bark” (unergatives) are different from verbs like “sink” and “melt” (unaccusatives), even though they both describe single-argument events. The difference has to do with argument structure—where the subject comes from in the underlying syntax. It has been argued that the subjects of unaccusatives are actually ‘deep objects’ for lack of a better term, and they structurally start in the same position as any other object.\nThey showed that these two verb types behave differently in production experiments. Speakers plan them differently. They tested this by showing related or unrelated words superimposed on the pictures. They found that when the verbs were related, participants slowed down before they started speaking—but only with unaccusatives. His theoretical claim was that unaccusative verbs are planned earlier in the sentence production process—possibly right at the beginning, along with the subject.\n\n\n\nHere’s the thing. Another thing that made me very excited about the production endeavor is that there are probably so many possible confounds that require checking. And I love this song and dance in psycholinguistics, where I can stress-test findings and see how stable they are. It’s especially important when you find an unexpected result—like participants taking longer to start speaking when they won’t say the verb for at least 3 more seconds—my first instinct, and I hope yours, is to wonder: “Is this real, or is something else going on?”\nThis post is built on a very specific worry: What if unaccusative scenes themselves, and not the syntax of them, created the results? One interesting finding in Shota Momma’s papers was that unergative planning was seemingly invisible. He has shown that there are reasons to believe that it happens while saying the second NP. But quantitatively, the signature of unergative planning seems to be more dissolved throughout the sentence, while the unaccusative planning is strikingly clear.\nThis creates the following question: is it possible that participants, simply because the picture was more difficult to understand or the subject was more involved in the action, spent more time initially to either understand the event or to extract the subject from the event, and during this time a deterministic analysis of the written word kicked in and slowed them down when it was related? Since the unergative subjects are more easily dissociable from the event, since nothing is happening to them in those pictures, it takes less time, and since it’s less of a resource-heavy process, no additional process interferes with it. This has several predictions. First, in follow-up experiments where the unergative pictures are hard to ‘retrieve’ from the scene, one should see similar onset effects. Second, if there is some sort of picture-difficulty metric, the advance planning should align with that metric item-wise.\nThe second prediction is going to be the basis of this blog post, where we will find a way to quantify the picture difficulty.\n\n\n\nI assume the following ‘two-way’ distinction with respect to lexical verbs. However, one needs to admit that unaccusativity is not stable all the time. Many such unaccusative verbs can be used as unergatives given some adverbial modification or different contexts. This would create some minor infelicity in English, but that is not the case for many languages. For example, Laz can make any verb ‘agentive’ with a small prefix. Imagine a Laz-type English where you have “I cried” vs. “I do-cried,” where the second one means that you made yourself cry or you deliberately cried. Or a better example might be: imagine if English “jump” were decomposable into a prefix “do-” and “fall.” So, for now I only assume that these properties are lexical properties of the verb, but one needs to admit that these are event-related ones.\n\nUnergative actions (swimming, barking, running): The action is performed by the agent.

The octopus isn’t “doing” boiling—it’s undergoing a change of state. The action and the entity are less separable.\n\nAnother assumption I make is about CLIP/VLM.

    "text": "The Finding\nHere’s what I found, which provides a fascinating, nuanced picture:\n\nCLIP Similarity: Unaccusative scenes had comparable or slightly higher similarity scores than unergative scenes. This means the visual information is definitely “there.”\nSubject Salience: The subject nouns were equally identifiable in both conditions (strong evidence against the idea that the character is hard to find).\nQwen-VL-Chat Scores: Here’s the twist. The Qwen model gave significantly lower ratings to the unaccusative image-sentence pairs.\n\nWait, what does this divergence mean?\n\nSubject Salience: The Baseline is Solid\nThe subject salience analysis is crucial. By measuring how well CLIP can match the subject noun alone (e.g., “octopus”, “ballerina”) to the image, we confirm that the characters are visually prominent.\nThe results show that subject nouns are equally identifiable across both verb types. This rules out the simplest form of perceptual difficulty: that participants just can’t find who is in the scene because they are occluded or small.\n\n\nThe CLIP vs. Qwen Split\nThe divergence between CLIP (similarity) and Qwen (explicit verification) is actually quite revealing.\n\nCLIP looks at the raw semantic match. It says, “Yes, this image contains the features of an octopus and boiling.”\nQwen-VL-Chat, acting more like a human observer asked to make a judgment, says, “This is a bit of a weird way to describe this scene.”\n\nThis suggests that while the clear visual information is present (CLIP), the event integration might indeed be more cognitively demanding (Qwen), mirroring the human behavior we see in the experiment (longer onset latencies)."

Instead, it helps us pinpoint where the difficulty lies. It’s not a low-level “I can’t see it” problem (which would be a confound). It’s likely a higher-level “conceptualizing this event is harder” issue—which might be exactly why unaccusative syntax is processed differently!\nWe can be confident that the onset latency effects aren’t due to bad drawings or hidden characters, but potentially reflect the genuine cognitive cost of encoding these specific types of events."

We’re not just running experiments and hoping for the best—we’re using computational tools to validate our materials in ways that weren’t possible even a few years ago.\nVision-language models like CLIP and multimodal LLMs like QWEN give us principled ways to ask: “Are these pictures doing what we think they’re doing?” The fact that we can now triangulate across different model architectures—similarity-based vs. generative—makes the validation even stronger. CLIP provides fast, quantitative similarity scores, while multimodal LLMs can provide more nuanced, human-interpretable ratings.\nThe convergence of evidence from both CLIP and multimodal LLMs provides a robust validation framework for experimental materials."

Both CLIP and multimodal LLMs like Qwen2-VL are freely available, relatively easy to use, and can give you valuable insights into whether your materials are doing what you think they’re doing. The fact that you can now validate your stimuli using multiple computational approaches—from simple similarity scoring to sophisticated multimodal reasoning—provides unprecedented confidence in your experimental materials.\nPlus, it’s just fun to see what these models “think” about your carefully crafted experimental stimuli. Sometimes they agree with each other and with you. Sometimes they surprise you. Either way, you learn something."

I am currently working on to reconcile conflicting findings on whether attraction effects are modulated by case ambiguity in sentence comprehension. My goal is to eventually tie this to the work focusing on exploring how people access memory and why we need to recontruct them using either abstract or form-related cues. Broadly, I’m interested in online addressable memory-building, its interaction with syntactic dependencies in typologically different languages, and the nature of the mechanisms and representations this interaction involves.\nWith Pavel Logacev, I focused on whether people’s failure to notice ungrammatical sentences was due to more cognitive-general issues such as, response bias, shallow processing, or task-effects. Through series of behavioral experiments, we learned that even though that they affect to what degree people fail to assess grammaticality of a sentence, these cognitive-general issues cannot be sole explanation of failure to detect ungrammaticality.\n\nSelected Output\n\nTürk, U., Logacev, P.

Following these guidelines, we re-annotated two already existing treebanks, and created a new treebank.\nAs a part of my efforts to document minority languages, we also created the first Laz treebank, using data from published linguistic papers and theses.

I formalized the degree-sensitivity of Turkish Evaluative morphology, specifically “diminutives”. Adjectival diminutives, in Turkish, only attach to negative-ordered adjectives. I also showed that Turkish -CIK is actually a complex formative unlike previously believed. While -K is an inherent part of the adjective, -CI is the amplifier that attaches to defective adjective “root” that is stripped from -K.\nI also tried to formalize differential object marking in Turkish. Using nanosyntactic algorithm, I modeled the nominal case paradigm of Turkish.\nLastly, I argued that candidates in morphology can be re-ranked via phonological information. Words with root suppletion generally are not licensed in suspended affixation. However, preceding only a vowel-harmonic conjunction, suppletion was reverted and suspended affixation was licensed.\n\nSelected Output\n\nTürk, U., Caha, P. (2021).

[link] [doi]\n\n\n\n\nSemantics\nWith Omer Demirok, we investigated how hypothetical comparions are formed in Turkish. -mışcasına is licensed with gradable adjectives but not with non-gradable ones. We took this to suggest that its semantics involves comparison of degrees. We pursued a previously uncharted route: HCM constructions in Turkish compare degrees, not eventualities. Our analysis is sensitive to the semantic difference between OPEN and CLOSE scale adjectives that are independently justified.\nRecently, with Aron Hirsch, I started working on the semantics of polar questions and question particles. We investigate how scope rigidity interacts with focus sensitive question particles and syntactic alternatives in Turkish.\nI am also interested in how pragmatic reality is structured in natural language such as personal experiences, interpretation of indefinite nouns, and justified beliefs. To investigate these topics, I use data from de re/de dicto and acquaintance inference literature.\n\nSelected Output\n\nTürk, U., Demirok, Ö. (2021). Hypothetical Comparison in Turkish.

    "title": "is /j/ really a sonorant in turkish? i guess not.",
    "section": "",
    "text": "This work started as a term paper for our master’s phonology class with Semra Ozdemir. She was interested in the properties of sonorants and I was interested in the phonetics of them. We saw that in many environments Turkish glide /j/ acts differently than other sonorants. The fact that /j/ was the only phonemic glide in Turkish was already interesting by itself. We asked the following question: Is it really a glide?\nWe looked at certain phonological behaviors of the /j/: (i) /h/ deletion prior to sonorants, (ii) consonant-clusters in coda, and (iii) [e]-lowering prior to sonorants. We also conducted a phonetics experiment where we asked people to read sentences that contains sonorants in word-final, word-initial, and intervocalic positions following the sound [e]. Our results from this experiment can be seen in the figure below.\n\n\n\nFigure 1. F1 and F2 values of individual utterances of the mid-front vowel e.We grouped these instances into two: following /j/ or following a non-/j/ sound.\n\n\nWe saw that /j/ behaves nothing like a sonorant. When the sound /j/ follows the mid-front vowel [e], it did not lower the vowel. However, every other sonorant (non-/j/) substantially lowered the vowel. Even though, it is clear that /j/ does not act like a sonorant, we were indecisive whether it were unspecified with respect to its sonoracy or it was just a fricative.\nLater on, Stefano Canalis and Umit Tuncer also joined us in this project. With their help, we decided that /j/ is a phonemically fricative in Turkish, but may show sonorant-like behavior in certain environments. With them, we looked at the phonemic behavior of /j/ in more environments. We also investigated the feature symmetry in Turkish.\nWe saw that other phonetic sonorants in Turkish were also phonemically fricative and /j/ and other sonorants become sonorant-like in the very same environments."

    "title": "unaccusativity syntax or picture difficulty?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "During my PhD, I’ve become fairly obsessed with production studies. I find them extremely interesting, especially the way they combine what we know from theoretical linguistics with creative experimental methods. Not to mention that the theoretical framing of production work is quite poor and the main theories used need a major overhaul. One of the most interesting papers in this area is Shota Momma’s work on advanced verb planning. Similar work was also done in German and Basque by Sebastian Sauppe’s group.\nLet me set the scene. He and his colleagues ran multiple picture description experiments where participants saw images like: - “The octopus below the spoon is swimming” (unergative) - “The octopus below the spoon is boiling” (unaccusative)\nIf you’re not a syntax nerd, here’s the ultra-compressed version: verbs like “swim” and “bark” (unergatives) are different from verbs like “sink” and “melt” (unaccusatives), even though they both describe single-argument events. The difference has to do with argument structure—where the subject comes from in the underlying syntax. It has been argued that the subjects of unaccusatives are actually ‘deep objects’ for lack of a better term, and they structurally start in the same position as any other object.\nThey showed that these two verb types behave differently in production experiments. Speakers plan them differently. They tested this by showing related or unrelated words superimposed on the pictures. They found that when the verbs were related, participants slowed down before they started speaking—but only with unaccusatives. His theoretical claim was that unaccusative verbs are planned earlier in the sentence production process—possibly right at the beginning, along with the subject.\n\n\n\nHere’s the thing. Another thing that made me very excited about the production endeavor is that there are probably so many possible confounds that require checking. And I love this song and dance in psycholinguistics, where I can stress-test findings and see how stable they are. It’s especially important when you find an unexpected result—like participants taking longer to start speaking when they won’t say the verb for at least 3 more seconds—my first instinct, and I hope yours, is to wonder: “Is this real, or is something else going on?”\nThis post is built on a very specific worry: What if unaccusative scenes themselves, and not the syntax of them, created the results? One interesting finding in Shota Momma’s papers was that unergative planning was seemingly invisible. He has shown that there are reasons to believe that it happens while saying the second NP. But quantitatively, the signature of unergative planning seems to be more dissolved throughout the sentence, while the unaccusative planning is strikingly clear.\nThis creates the following question: is it possible that participants, simply because the picture was more difficult to understand or the subject was more involved in the action, spent more time initially to either understand the event or to extract the subject from the event, and during this time a deterministic analysis of the written word kicked in and slowed them down when it was related? Since the unergative subjects are more easily dissociable from the event, since nothing is happening to them in those pictures, it takes less time, and since it’s less of a resource-heavy process, no additional process interferes with it. This has several predictions. First, in follow-up experiments where the unergative pictures are hard to ‘retrieve’ from the scene, one should see similar onset effects. Second, if there is some sort of picture-difficulty metric, the advance planning should align with that metric item-wise.\nThe second prediction is going to be the basis of this blog post, where we will find a way to quantify the picture difficulty.\n\n\n\nI assume the following ‘two-way’ distinction with respect to lexical verbs. However, one needs to admit that unaccusativity is not stable all the time. Many such unaccusative verbs can be used as unergatives given some adverbial modification or different contexts. This would create some minor infelicity in English, but that is not the case for many languages. For example, Laz can make any verb ‘agentive’ with a small prefix. Imagine a Laz-type English where you have “I cried” vs. “I do-cried,” where the second one means that you made yourself cry or you deliberately cried. Or a better example might be: imagine if English “jump” were decomposable into a prefix “do-” and “fall.” So, for now I only assume that these properties are lexical properties of the verb, but one needs to admit that these are event-related ones.\n\nUnergative actions (swimming, barking, running): The action is performed by the agent. You can see the octopus swimming—the action is somewhat separable from what happens to the entity.\nUnaccusative actions (boiling, melting, sinking): Something is happening to the entity. The octopus isn’t “doing” boiling—it’s undergoing a change of state. The action and the entity are less separable.\n\nAnother assumption I make is about CLIP/VLM. The input that CLIP takes is a written sentence and a picture. I am fully aware that the way CLIP assesses pictures is nowhere near how humans do.1 I am also aware that in human speech, the scenes are what is encoded and the speech is the decoding. CLIP works differently. CLIP is a two-encoder model. Given two inputs of a picture and a text, it creates two separate vectors and checks how similar those vectors are. Thus, it does not give us anything about human cognition. But it gives us a way to quantify relevant metrics. Below what I assume to be the models of human speech production based on Levelt’s work and CLIP’s architecture.\nLevelt’s Speech Production Model:\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart TD\n    A[Conceptualizer] --&gt; |Preverbal Message| B[Formulator]\n    B --&gt; |Grammatical Encoding| C[Mental Lexicon&lt;br/&gt;Lemmas]\n    C --&gt; B\n    B --&gt; |Phonological Encoding| D[Mental Lexicon&lt;br/&gt;Forms]\n    D --&gt; B\n    B --&gt; |Phonetic Plan| E[Articulator]\n    E --&gt; |Overt Speech| F[Overt Speech]\n    F --&gt; |Auditory Feedback| G[Speech Comprehension&lt;br/&gt;System]\n    G -.-&gt; A\n\n    style A fill:#e1f5dd\n    style B fill:#d4e9f7\n    style C fill:#fff3cd\n    style D fill:#fff3cd\n    style E fill:#ffd4e5\n    style F fill:#f8d7da\n    style G fill:#e8e8e8\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCLIP Architecture:\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart TD\n    A[Picture] --&gt; B[Image Encoder]\n    C[Text] --&gt; D[Text Encoder]\n    B --&gt; E[Image Embedding]\n    D --&gt; F[Text Embedding]\n    E --&gt; G[Similarity Score]\n    F --&gt; G\n\n    style A fill:#e1f5dd\n    style C fill:#e1f5dd\n    style B fill:#d4e9f7\n    style D fill:#d4e9f7\n    style E fill:#fff3cd\n    style F fill:#fff3cd\n    style G fill:#f8d7da\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMultimodal LLMs:\nMore recently, multimodal large language models have emerged that work quite differently from CLIP. Instead of creating separate embeddings and comparing them, these models integrate visual and textual information into a unified representation and can generate natural language descriptions or answers about images.\nI have to say, writing their code is also a bit funny. You basically have to build a pipeline where you create a ‘chat template’ and ask them to give you an output. I am not sure that is how you are supposed to use them, but it works.2\nModels like Qwen3-Omni take both images and text as input, process them through vision encoders and language models together, and generate coherent text outputs. Unlike CLIP’s similarity metric, multimodal LLMs can provide richer, more nuanced interpretations of visual scenes and answer complex questions about them. We will use both of them and compare here.\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart TD\n    A[Picture] --&gt; B[Vision Encoder]\n    C[Text Prompt] --&gt; D[Tokenizer]\n    B --&gt; E[Visual Tokens]\n    D --&gt; F[Text Tokens]\n    E --&gt; G[Unified LLM]\n    F --&gt; G\n    G --&gt; H[Generated Text Output]\n\n    style A fill:#e1f5dd\n    style C fill:#e1f5dd\n    style B fill:#d4e9f7\n    style D fill:#d4e9f7\n    style E fill:#fff3cd\n    style F fill:#fff3cd\n    style G fill:#ffd4e5\n    style H fill:#f8d7da\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLastly, these experiments were conducted as a extended-PWI experiment, where participants were provided with a picture with a superimposed text on it. Neither the pictures, nor the tasks I improvise here does not have any relation to picture word interference task. It would be indeed interesting if we have an understanding how PWI would look like interms of LLM tasks. However it is far from what I would like to achieve here. If I have that idea I will probably submit a paper or an abstract somewhere :).\n\n\n\nIf unaccusative actions (like “boiling” or “melting”) are genuinely harder to see in pictures, or if the subjects are harder to visually identify in the scenes, we’d expect: - Lower similarity scores between the images and their target sentences - Evidence that models struggle to “ground” the sentence/entity in the visual input, in the form of subject saliency.\nIf that’s the case, we have a problem—the onset latency effect might just be about picture difficulty.3\nBut if the similarity scores are comparable or higher for unaccusatives, then we can rule out the perceptual confound for now and be more confident that the effects reflect genuine linguistic processing."

To really understand the strength of the evidence, we need to go beyond just comparing averages. This is where Bayesian analysis comes in.\nInstead of just getting a single number for the difference, a Bayesian regression gives us a full range of plausible values for the effect of VerbType on our scores, along with a measure of our certainty.\nFor the nerds out there, I used Pyro to run three separate models: two simple linear regressions for the CLIP and Subject Salience scores, and an ordered logistic regression for the VLM scores (since they are on a 1-10 scale). In all models, the key parameter is beta, which represents the estimated difference between unaccusative and unergative verbs.\nHere’s the code to set up and run the models:\n\nimport torch\nimport

Because of this math, our “Beta” (β) represents the difference: Unaccusative minus Unergative.\n\nThe Zero Line (The “Null”)\n\nThe vertical gray line at 0 represents “no difference”. If a model’s “cigar” is centered here, it means the model treats both picture types exactly the same.\n\nThe Left Side (Negative β)\n\nIf the distribution is on the left, the score for Unaccusatives was lower than Unergatives.\nThe Finding: This is the “Danger Zone” for our stimuli. It means Unaccusative pictures are harder for the models to understand or identify.\nOur Result: Both Full Scene (CLIP) and Scene Verification (VLM) are shifted heavily to the left. This tells us that, visually speaking, the unaccusative pictures are significantly less clear or representative than the unergative ones.\n\nThe Right Side (Positive β)\n\nIf the distribution were on the right, it would mean Unaccusatives scored higher.\nThe Finding: This would suggest Unaccusative pictures are actually “better” or “easier” than Unergative ones.\nOur Result: None of our models show this\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Data dictionary from your MCMC samples\nbeta_data = {\n    'Full Scene (CLIP)': clip_samples['beta'].numpy(),\n    'Subject Salience (CLIP)': subject_samples['beta'].numpy(),\n    'Scene Verification (VLM)': vlm_samples['beta'].numpy()\n}\n\n# Adjust figure size for better vertical separation\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 7))\nsns.set_style(\"whitegrid\", {'axes.grid': True, 'grid.color': '.95'})\n\nlabels = list(beta_data.keys())\ncolors = ['#3498db', '#9b59b6', '#e74c3c']\n\nfor i, label in enumerate(labels):\n    samples = beta_data[label]\n    mean_val = samples.mean()\n    \n    # 1.

Sauppe’s group found bunch of advance planning cases, where participant were faster to start speaking when they do not need to plan ahead for the verbal elements.\nSimilarly Momma and Yoshida shown advance planning in sentence-reall experiments. they shown that people were slower to start speaking when they say sentences such as ‘Which computer did you buy and repair?’ when there was a related verb to repairing.\nimportant this only happened with ‘ATB’ type of sentences, and not parasitic gap sentences such as ‘Which computer did you repair after buying?’."

    "section": "Conclusion",
    "text": "Conclusion\n\nThe Finding\nThe analysis reveals a consistent pattern across all three metrics: unaccusative scenes are rated as more difficult or less representative by the models compared to unergative scenes.\n\nScene Verification (VLM): The Qwen-VL model, which was asked to explicitly rate the match between the sentence and the image, showed a strong negative effect for unaccusatives. It consistently gave lower scores to unaccusative pairs, with a high degree of certainty (P(β&lt;0) = 0.99). This suggests that from a generative, “common sense” perspective, the unaccusative sentences are poorer descriptions of their corresponding images.\nFull Scene Similarity (CLIP): The standard CLIP similarity score also revealed a strong negative effect for unaccusatives (P(β&lt;0) = 0.92). This indicates that the overall visual-textual fit is lower for unaccusative scenes.\nSubject Salience (CLIP): Even the salience of the subject noun was moderately lower in unaccusative scenes (P(β&lt;0) = 0.83). While the evidence is weaker here, it suggests that the subject may be slightly harder to identify in the context of an unaccusative event.\n\nIn short, the models are telling us that the unaccusative pictures are not as clear-cut as the unergative ones.\n\n\nWhat This Means\nThis computational analysis provides a crucial piece of context for the human experimental results. The key takeaway is that the unaccusative stimuli seem to be inherently more complex or ambiguous than the unergative stimuli.\nThis doesn’t invalidate the syntactic hypothesis about advance planning, but it does add a layer of nuance. The increased processing cost observed in human speakers for unaccusative sentences might not be solely due to a syntactic operation. Instead, it could be a combination of factors:\n\nPerceptual/Conceptual Difficulty: The visual scenes for unaccusative events might be harder to parse, conceptualize, and map onto a linguistic description. The AI models, particularly the VLM, seem to be picking up on this.\nSyntactic Planning: The syntactic structure of unaccusatives may still require earlier planning, as originally hypothesized.\n\nThe most likely scenario is that these two factors are intertwined. The very nature of unaccusative events (a change of state happening to a patient) makes them visually more complex, and this complexity might be what triggers the earlier, more resource-intensive syntactic planning.\nWe can be more confident that the experimental effects are not just due to simple visual confounds like a hidden subject, but we must also acknowledge that the “difficulty” is not purely syntactic. It’s a property of the entire event, from perception to syntax."

We’re not just running experiments and hoping for the best—we’re using computational tools to validate our materials in ways that weren’t possible even a few years ago.\nVision-language models like CLIP and multimodal LLMs like QWEN give us principled ways to ask: “Are these pictures doing what we think they’re doing?” The fact that we can now triangulate across different model architectures—similarity-based vs. generative—makes the validation even stronger. CLIP provides fast, quantitative similarity scores, while multimodal LLMs can provide more nuanced, human-interpretable ratings.\nThe convergence of evidence from both CLIP and multimodal LLMs provides a robust validation framework for experimental materials.\nIf you want to run this analysis yourself, you can use the following Colab notebook:\n\n\n\nOpen In Colab"

And that’s exactly what good methodological work should do.\nIf you’re running experiments with visual stimuli, I highly recommend giving this kind of analysis a try. Both CLIP and multimodal LLMs like Qwen2-VL are freely available, relatively easy to use, and can give you valuable insights into whether your materials are doing what you think they’re doing. The fact that you can now validate your stimuli using multiple computational approaches—from simple similarity scoring to sophisticated multimodal reasoning—provides unprecedented confidence in your experimental materials.\nPlus, it’s just fun to see what these models “think” about your carefully crafted experimental stimuli. Sometimes they agree with each other and with you. Sometimes they surprise you. Either way, you learn something."

You need depictions of transitive actions that are valid, recognizable, but also controlled. You want your “Wizard” to look like the same Wizard whether he’s eating an apple or throwing a frisbee.\nFinding consistent pictures for picture word interference tasks—or even simple production tasks that involve lexical verbs—is notoriously difficult. Most existing resources and production experiments focus heavily on nominals (nouns). Finding relevant images on the web is also very difficult. And whenever, you want to use stock images, you worry about a lot of different stuff going on in each image. Many acquisition labs actually record their students do the actions for other type of experiments.\nI recently needed 60 distinct, stylistically consistent line drawings for a morphology experiment. I didn’t want to spend weeks drawing or learning how to draw them, and I didn’t want to wrestle with inconsistencies from standard web-based image generators or image searching. Existing databases did not provide a good quality verb sentences.\nSo, I built a code-first pipeline using Google’s Gemini 2.5 Flash Image and open-source alternatives like FLUX.1 via Hugging Face.\nHere is how I did it."

    "title": "agreement attraction in turkish",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The term agreement attraction is used to describe either increased acceptability of ungrammatical sentences or reduced difficulty in reading ungrammatical sentences. This was made possible by an illusionary element which matches with the features of the verb, thus attracting the probe of the agreement from the head noun to itself.   Consider the following sentence: “*The key to the cabinets are rusty.” Even though it is ungrammatical, people systematically accepted these sentences more often than the ones with the word “attractor.” They also spend less time when there is a plural nominal like “cabinets” rather than the word “cabinet.”   This thesis tries to explore how the attraction phenomenon interacts with issues like case syncretism, form heuristics, response bias, and register, all of which are rarely investigated in the literature. This thesis also provides an extensive, but not exhaustive, picture of attraction effects in Turkish, an understudied language in psycholinguistics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteAbstract\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this thesis, I investigate the existing agreement attraction effects in Turkish and how these effects interact with various phenomenon such as (i) case syncretism and local ambiguity, (ii) form heuristics, (iii) response bias, and (iv) honorific readings. Previous studies have shown that speakers occasionally find ungrammatical sentences violating number agreement acceptable when there is another noun sharing same number with the verb, in other words exhibited agreement attraction. Lago et al. (2019) found that genitive-possessive structures were able to induce agreement attraction effects within native Turkish speakers in a speeded acceptability experiment. However, due to the nature of the Turkish and acceptability studies, there are multiple alternative explanations for the existing effects. This thesis aims to weed out possible confounds and clarify the effects by conducting four speeded acceptability judgment experiments. We showed (i) that case-ambiguity on the head noun does not play a role in Turkish agreement attraction (Experiment 1, N = 118), (ii) that participants do not use form-driven-processing-strategies to answer judgment questions (Experiments 2A, N = 80, and 2B, N = 95), (iii) that response bias induced ungrammaticality illusion and only decreased the magnitude of grammaticality illusion (Experiment 3, N = 114), and (iv) that a possible honorific reading does not license superfluous plural marking at the verb (Experiment 4, N = 174). Together, our results challenge cue-based retrieval accounts of agreement attraction and can be accommodated by accounts that assume attraction occurs due to erroneous encodings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipDefense Slides\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantThesis\n\n\n\n\n\nBogazici Page | Local PDF | Overleaf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotePlots from defense & some more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoneExp1 Averages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoneExp1 Models\n\n\n\n\n\nBayesian Model fitted to all experimental items\n\nBayesian Model fitted to only ungrammatical experimental items\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoneExp2A Averages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoneExp2A Models\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoneExp2B Averages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoneExp2B Models\n\n\n\n\n\nBayesian Model fitted to all experimental items\n\nBayesian Model fitted to only experimental items with RC attractors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoneExp3 Averages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoneHammerly et al. (2019) Averages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoneHammerly et al. (2019) Bias Informed Averages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoneHammerly et al. (2019) Bias Informed Model\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoneExp3 Bias-Related\n\n\n\n\n\nParticipants Bias in our Experiment 3 using fillers and Bayes Factor for parametric t-test\n\nParticipants Bias in Hammerly et al. (2019) using fillers and experimental items as well as Bayes Factor for parametric t-tests\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoneExp3 Models\n\n\n\n\n\nBayesian Model fitted to only ungrammatical experimental items\n\nBayesian Model fitted to only grammatical experimental items\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoneExp4 Averages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoneExp4 Models\n\n\n\n\n\nBayesian Model fitted to all experimental items\n\nBayesian Model fitted to only informal experimental items\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupplementary links\n\nDownload Full Thesis\nGithub Repo\nAll Code (Grouped according to the chapters)\nExperiment Raw Data\nLago et al.’s (2019) work\nHammerly et al.’s (2019) work\nCode for nicer plots from the defense\nExperiment 1\nExperiment 2A\nExperiment 2B\nExperiment 3\nExperiment 4"

    "text": "This post grew out of a conversation I had with a professor about his workshop class on Turkic languages. He didn’t say this directly, but I’ve heard a familiar story from multiple students: when Turkish comes up, some chunk of class time gets involuntarily eaten by judgment battles.\nHonestly, I’m not shocked. Since my MA I’ve heard plenty of “your Turkish is broken”. Mostly joking, sure. But there’s also a pattern: any talk with mildly non-obvious Turkish data gets peppered with unsolicited “That’s not grammatical to me” interventions. And yes, I’ve done it too. I’m not writing this from a high horse. This is also a personal critique.1\nWhat I want to argue is simple: a lot of this practice is both methodologically unhelpful and kind of backwards relative to what many of us claim to be doing in linguistics.\nAnd there’s a second point, which I care about more. Behind the futility of casual judgment policing, there’s a real lesson: people are often trying to say something important, but the only sentence they know how to produce in these contexts is “that’s ungrammatical”.\nPS. I’m writing this for linguists who are trying to understand what humans can do with language, what the limits are, and how the system is represented and deployed. If your main goal is to recover the “standard Turkish grammar” shared uniformly by all self-identified Turkish speakers, I genuinely wish you luck, but I don’t have much to offer beyond a lot of questions."

    "text": "What does “That’s not grammatical to me” even mean?\nSuppose you present a Turkish example and someone raises a hand (or asks a question after the talk) and says:\n\n“I don’t think that sentence is grammatical.”\n\nThat utterance is wildly underspecified. Here are a few things it can be (implicitly) trying to express.\n\nSometimes it (accidentally) sounds like: “You made this up.”\nThat’s a serious accusation. In my experience, almost nobody in our field intends that. But the performative effect can still be: “your data is suspect”.\nSometimes they simply enjoy tautological facts: “People differ, ‘standard language’ is a fiction, I-language matters.”\nTrue. Also not news. And as a conversational move, it sometimes functions like: “I don’t want you to talk to me (about this)”.\nSometimes it’s straightforward prescriptivism: “There is one Turkish, and let me tell you this isn’t it.”\nI’m still surprised how often this shows up in linguistics, including among people who otherwise talk a good game about variation and competence vs performance.\nSometimes it’s an underlying strong claim about what ‘language’ is.\nThey might not think the individual brain can exercise the language faculty to different degrees, and they might (maybe unknowingly) treat “your language” as something defined almost entirely by your social circle.\nI have two problems with this. First, speaker and listener often aren’t in the same community. Turkish is also especially sensitive to region, register, education, and class (don’t quote me on the comparative point here; I might just be more attuned to Turkish differences than to differences in other languages, but the general point still stands). Even with English speakers, judgments are not uniform, and plenty of cases are genuinely disputable. Second, even if social environment matters a lot, it’s a strange move to treat one person’s system as the yardstick that can revoke another person’s linguistic competence. We already accept that humans share a broad blueprint. We also often accept that speakers who understand each other effortlessly share even more. But once you zoom in (Turkish vs “Turkish”, dialect vs dialect, idiolect vs idiolect), we’re talking about degrees, and the differences you find are often local and structured, not “brokenness”.\nSometimes it reflects not having thought much about what edge cases buy you: “I actually haven’t thought about what there is to learn from edge cases.”\nIn a world where there are many possible grammars (and many plausible formalizations), marginal cases are often where constraints show up. The “net return” on hunting boundaries can be high, precisely because broad generalizations saturate quickly. This is not to say we’ve done enough work on the “simple” examples, or that we should stop caring about them. But if your goal is to dissociate what is possible in the human language system, the marginal cases often have unusually good signal.\n\nAnd then there’s the version that is actually methodologically relevant."

    "text": "Real worry I: Representativeness\nOften what the objector means is something like:\n\n“You’re portraying this as common in the language, but it’s only available for a subset of speakers.”\n\nIf I’m being serious, I think this is what’s going on in a big fraction of “this is ungrammatical” interruptions. And yes, it can matter, because it affects what future readers take to be a baseline fact.\nBut notice what that worry requires you to do. You have to say more than “not for me”.\nAt minimum, you need to turn it into an empirical claim:\n\nWhich speakers? (region, register, age cohort, bilingualism history, etc.)\nHow big is the split? (rare? unstable? gradient? categorical for a subgroup?)\nWhat exactly differs? (syntax? morphology? prosody? information structure? lexical choice?)\nIs the judgment robust under controlled elicitation? (multiple prompts, contexts, minimal pairs)\n\nIf this is not an empirical worry but a “philosophy of science” worry, in the sense that a paper might mislead outsiders into thinking Turkish works in a certain way, the fix is not heckling. The fix is metadata and methodology. I genuinely do not understand why so many syntax/semantics papers lack a short subsection about who the speakers were and what the elicitation conditions were.\nAlso, in practice, any work that seriously builds on Turkish facts should be doing basic replication of the descriptive premise anyway. If you’re going to hang theory on a datum you saw in a talk, you should first check that datum (with speakers, corpora, or both). That’s not a Turkish-specific point. And yes, I’ve unfortunately also seen famous linguists publish on languages they hadn’t worked on before, not even opening a grammar book, and then argue that facts reported in some earlier paper can be “explained away”. This is a different problem, but it’s in the same family."

I care a lot about cross-linguistic structure, and about how the “borders” of grammatical processes are patterned rather than random. Mapping where variation arises (and where it doesn’t) can be informative about representational choices and decision points in the system.\nBut again, “that’s ungrammatical to me” is a terrible way to pursue that agenda if it comes with no follow-up. It’s like walking into a lab meeting, saying “noise”, and leaving.\nIf you think variation is the point, then do variation: ask about variation. Propose a hypothesis about the dimensions along which it varies, and propose how you’d test it."

But it still matters how you ask it.\nA better way to do this is to ask what diagnostics were run and whether the result survives them. Or whether there are “asterisks” that need to be made explicit. Sometimes that’s the real disconnect: you’re using “grammatical” in a looser, more exploratory way, while the audience is using it in the “passes the canonical tests in the canonical contexts” way."
